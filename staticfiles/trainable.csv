why are we indians bad at taking risks www reddit com india comments fzrn why are we indians bad at taking risks the thing is they have governments to save their asses in case of unemployment we don also status they arent afraid to do small odd jobs at mcdonalds or babysitting or something like that we are taught that such jobs are only for the uneducated and unqualified and only prestigous job would get us somewhere in societywait m confused are you equating intelligence iq grades or however you choose to define it which is problem in itself with risk and success are you saying that the smarter someone is the more risk they should be taking and will hence get rewarded eventually also what is high risk job or no risk job is the assumption that most indian parents have surplus money sitting around that they can invest willingly in high risk jobs that their offspring others want to undertake but they don maybe ll understand better if this is clarified because sharma ji ka beta lot of us can afford go take risks if we fail then it back to poverty being poor in india isn like being poor in america it very very difficult to escape poverty here because of the corruption we have more to lose becoming destitute in western country is better than becoming destitute in india americans are taught to take risks from the onset we re not we lead far more shielded life to may same routine nd mundane but atleast there food on the plate at the end of the dayi feel you took risk and skipped going to college because just can bother myself to mug up shit and be in an institutionalized way of learning so just started with an internship and moved onto freelancing no regrets only masti it a process according to me believe our generation or the next generation will be more passionate to start something of their own in comparison to our parents plus being from banaya family know castism is shit but don know never thought of job as an option ever as haven seen my father do the same genes may be working towards the same too also unemployment rates are pretty high if don get succeeded might starve to death if you are born in low financial status family then job becomes more important as the entire family is dependent on you one cannot imagine to take risks for that given situation don have the stats but majority of indians fall into this category starting start up and running it successfully and then creating full fledged corporation are very different things just look at byju it took him almost decade to create successful company also if you re not from tier institution no vc gives shit about you also watch silicon valley hbo that show will tell you how difficult it is to start something and then dial the difficulties faced by them by since situation in india is worsebecause in india people are not awarded for their smartness we have to deal with so much side drama when doing anything that the main focus of what you are trying to build is lost also here we are not given free hand more than half of engineers learn what they are doing after working for years education system is sooo different as compared to to here there they teach you in way that you know where this would be applied in real life scenarios rather than just mugging it up the way exams are conducted are also different there you can get marks by just writing sentence here just have to fill pages to pass they teach you to learn and apply your brain here its just about getting grades and moving up because minimum wage is higher in western countries us has usd per hour as minimum wage forget about debts who the fuck will give money for simple day to day expenses if the venture fails what if parents aren financially secure it is easy to say things like this we know only about successful people for every bill gates and mark zuckerberg there are thousands of failed entrepreneurs school college job shadi that the fixer path that you must follow then have kids and make them do the same and retirereservation suitable are going to west and helping them ,AskIndia

mumbai in he was swarmed by security as he was leaving the college and got close to him as can beholding his glorious mop of white hair never has the death of person who don know saddened me as much as dr kalam did though not comparable understood how millions of indians felt when gandhi died or americans when hearing that kennedy was assassinated have said this before and will say this at every opportunity get want apj abdul kalam on my currency notes this makes me so sad back in class was bright student always taking part in extracurricular activities apart from getting top grades once dr kalam visited our school but the children of teachers were chosen to welcome him cried horribly after the incident did somebody else write the name and date or did he use different ink for some reason kalam ke kalam sehey it my birthday date laughed seeing the non political flair on this post after all this man name is pulled into every hindu muslim debate banter fight in vain considering dr kalam

something that priceless you must frame this dude making this sit in some junk is serious crime as see it love how no nonsense your autograph book is that preciousthats sooo coool man he was good man ah before selfieswould have better if he left his lineage behind the country is just going down the whirlpool nevertheless reskept his decision ps it probably is notepad think you should frame it

was reading wings of fire currently dude with your permission may save this image to my photo collection dr kalam was the greatest human being have seen and will ever see in my lifetime wonder if dr

you took kalam autograph on that bas pagle pagli rulayega rulayegi kya chinookhow old are you now cried the day he left who else shouldn you have kept it safely or had it framed lockdown reviving

incredibly stupid to read bigotry from india and forget where you are living the fact is that masjids in dubai are closed and everyone prays namaaz at home so even when this guy has seen muslims from various countries taking proper precautions he chooses to be bigot he cannot claim ignoranceyou need to special type of idiot if you hate big group of people because of their religion you need to be super special type of idiot to say that aloud when surrounded by the people you hate twitter has been overtaken by kannadiga anti islam trolls its bad hear the news channels out there are also

consequences for it when not living in india and doing this bigotry some proper dickheads from karnataka sanghi breeding ground this brother of mine works in place that restricts freedom of speech was born where million ideas flourish wants to make his birthplace become his workplace tastes the harsh reality of limited liberties my other brothers who hate his bigotry rejoice the punishment which is support for limited liberty but don want similar powers for the majority where they call home sad irony bruh that dubai thier government would actually do things to you which you read urban naxals marxists love jihadis etc etc doing in fake news stories if you make such stupid statements removed he should join bjp there bright future for him awaiting and he has all the qualifications required for the position like this many of these nri fuckers need to get taste of their own medicine either free speech for all or free speech for none insulting islam or any other religion for that matter is not bad thing to do there are lot of things that are wrong with islam and we should be able to attack or satirize against it using harsh language if we choose to doing so is not bigotry the problem is when criticism or satire of islam descends into hatred of muslims as in the case of some of the people in this story many people in this thread are salty of the fact that unlike in india this guy wasn able to freely abuse islam muslims in uae nice love all right wing met are like dubai lovers but forgets what it really is what are the people upto see some of my bigoted relatives put up an orange

they want to turn india into the with the rest of us deleted hate must have consequences all these countries have is money wish india were more prosperous so indians wouldn have to go work in such theocratic hellholes maybe the world should collectively force those countries to adopt de jure freedom of religion and speech too holy shit there are more islamist than secular on this thread edit what why the downvote insulting religion should be fundamental right irrespective of religion be it hinduism or islam or toothfairy ism but instead people are orgasming over the fact guy was caught

why does the government come with begging bowl during every crisis www reddit com india comments fxofyu why does the government come with a begging bowl don understand why they don use money from contingency fund there a separate fund called contingency fund contingency fund of india this fund is being held by the president of india he can spend from this fund for emergency and unforeseen circumstances no authorization from parliament is required public accounts of india bank savings account of the departments ministries national investment fund national calamity contingency fund nccf national small savings fund defence fund prarambhik shishak kosh mnrega fund provident fund postal insurance etc and so on no permission from parliament to government is required for spending from this account consolidated fund of india all the cash from direct and indirect taxes all the loans that are taken by the government of india and money returned as principal or interest of the loans given by the government this is the largest of all three funds the government needs parliament approval to spend money from this fund the amount of money we pay as our taxes they use it to gain goodwill for their parties state or center by freeing loans water electricity transport and even their election campaigns so in the time of actual needs they dont have enough funds to fight the crisis the govt of india central govt runs fiscal deficit every year this means that they spend more money than the revenue they raise note that this deficit needs to be financed which incurs additional costs the goi doesn earn much money because there is rampant tax evasion due to multitude of factors india has large unorganised off the books sector which doesn pay taxes the indian state doesn have the capacity to go after all tax evaders and prosecute them etc this results in the only reliable revenue streams for the govt being salaried tax payers gst collected and some other taxes from this gst payments have been less than projected because the govt vastly overestimated the broadening of the tax base post gst now large chunk of the govt expenditure goes into schemes for the upliftment of the poor and rural development etc etc the problem with this is that the state controls the disbursement of these funds and uses them to serve itself by the state mean people who are part of the state ie politicians and bureaucrats so taxpayer money is used for crony capitalism to gain favour with the electorate so they re elected again etc lot of this money also flows out of the system through corruption bureaucrats tasked with building toilets might only build and pocket the funds allocated for the other this is how taxpayer money in india is only used to serve politicians and bureaucrats interests and neither does the honest taxpayer see any return on their taxes and neither is any section of the society uplifted there is no accountability and no transparency potholed roads slow public transport namesake education and healthcareit not begging bowl it a psychological tactic they know you ll donate when the country is going through crisis even when we have enough money to handle the crisis and some stupid other projects which are approved during this crisis in past few weeks the fuck does my tax money go apart from paying salaires of inefficient incompetent underqualified government employees who underperform because the have job security because generations of people before you decided spine is an unneccesary thing that doesnt befit our indian culture now those with spines exploit and everyone spineless suffers blame the populace thats where all the govt employees come from because if they have to give out from the government kitty it means less money for politicians and their cronies to loot india is poor its banal and boring answer but it is still true india needs just insane amounts of money to build its infrastructure to first world levels india needs large amounts of time to build its human infrastructure non corrupt officers people used to following the law the habits of civilization our tax income isn superb our usage of money isn super we leak all over the place this means the government will always benefit from extra financial support during crisis it also gives people way to help which is what most civilized people do they feel bad when they see someone in trouble and want to help this is one way to do so dont you ever question where your tax money goes cant you see the tallest and most beautiful statue that has natural cooling system whenever it rains was built in india which country provides this much comfort don forget that cr statue and cr rajpath renovation and why the fuck politicians don pay tax it called corruption bro how else will they get their chai paanii agree with this line bhenchod why the fuck are you even collecting taxes from me if you are going to come begging again during time of crisis my sentiments exactly not to mention the taxpayer money spent on statues and meaning less parks the statue of unity alone cost around k crores bhenchod us ne bhi apna nhi banaya tha inko pata nhi kyun copy karni har western cheezi think in india corruption mismanagement in govt projects looses lot of money also lack of discipline in finances populist measures etc are other major drains none of those in power till date have shown courage to tackle these issues we have each one blaming others of corruption but no one even making an attempt to stop it thus there is always shortage of money when need arises maybe it could be political decision too people donate to show their loyalty it surprising nobody has realised that pm cares is scam pmrf is legit it gets audited pm cares is shady af just like those election bonds they sold large scale money laundering scheme just boosts bee jay pee mla buying capabilities all money went to statue of unity well once you agree to unmonitored political funds and donations once you agree to non independent audit and investigate agencies and judiciary once you agree to various political parties subsidizing religious events and setting up monuments to their preferred leader ideology once you agree to systems that don have accountability once you agree to unmonitored subsidies once you vote on various ideology rather than holding developmental goals and their fulfillment as the metric then saala paisa bacha kahan sab toh kharch huwa kha pee kar dakar gayain since there is no accountability they can say and do whatever they want and our dumbass society thinks of political employees as patriarchs and bow down to them unconditionally they build statuestax ka paisa se vote ka expenses chalta hai mandeer banta gundaraj chalta statue banta hai personal expenses chalta hai india has so much excise duty on electronic items laptops cameras mobiles are cheaper in other countries like us or uae luxury cars has huge import duty in india now we pay gst as well guys know it sometimes easy to forget this our urban middle class bubble but india is poor country we have massive rural population who are far poorer than most of us have even seen even in the best of times without any special events like floods terrorism viruses lakhs of people simply die of hunger in india an average of lakh to be precise we are country who cannot even afford to feed pretty sizable portion of our population under normal circumstances what the tiny urban middle class pays in tax goes into the normal functioning of the country but it far from enough edit not trying to defend our government spending before anyone gets that impression our governments do spend what little precious money they have on pointless things there is corruption in india don disagree with that but can also think of more than dozen possible avenues where our tax might be spent there is the electricity bills of all our government buildings the parliament and so on we not only pay your so called incompetent bureaucrats but we also pay our defense forces and doctors from the same money not to mention the countless subsidies lpg petrol diesel and the ration shops pulses rice and other food materials are sold at really subsidized rates education in government schools is free and they provide free meals to children in many states the government engineering medical colleges the iits do you think they run only on the money collected as fees think twice and compare the exorbitant fees collected in private colleges and the fees in government colleges we cant say that there has been zero development the road network and rail network is pretty good the government hospitals primary health centres all these run on tax money the personnel there don work for free and the people of india need incentives to take proper care of their daughters there are lot of female oriented schemes free education for single girl child and many others indians need to be paid or bribed for doing their duty as someone below mentioned less than percent actually pay taxes tax evasion is sadly what most indians do the government is forced to tax all products only then can the ordinary indian man live okayish life so think twice before swearing up and down that your tax money is disappearing and for the person who said he is okay paying flat percent as taxes calculate properly and take the time to digest the amount salary of l will generate tax of l doesn india have sovereign wealth fund of some sort wtf if they save our tax money to solve pandemics how the fuck are they gonna build statues the fuck does my tax money go apart from paying salaries of inefficient incompetent underqualified government employees who underperform because the have job security inefficient yes incompetent under qualified mostly no at least half of the government employees those who are not selected through reservation quota are fully competent and qualified as in most cases they have fought through cut throat competition in examinations and interviews although very small percentage of govt jobs are still got through connections and bribes the term underperform also does not apply exactly like private sector for most of the government organisation for example say post office the mandate of post office is to deliver mail and provide people with savings account or pli and some additional shit like electricity telephone bill payments etc the peak of the performance in case of post office employee is when all of the citizens approaching him her are able to avail services of postoffice satisfactorily so applying the term underperform for government employees is not similar to private companies where quarterly numbers profit year on year growth and so many other criteria of competitive markets are applicable when assessing the performance of an employee and as for where your money goes government employees also pay all the taxes you have mentioned where and how the money is utilised is political decision not bureaucratic one my best guess is that most people who own the most of the money in the system don pay enough or not pay at all so the tax payers money is completely used up while tending to everyday stuff that why there little to no funding during crisis times and not to forget corruption finally someone who voices the same question that have and most importantly if am paying taxes should know where my money is spent read about nhai fci read about how of revenue expenditure of govt is salaries and pensions read about how there are hundreds of government companies in losses which are subsidised by the govt read about how government banks are recapitalised with no change in how they function you ll realise the problem is that the government plays too much of role why does the government come with begging bowl during every crisis sara paisa toh ye madarchod nirav modi aur vijay malya jaise log le jate and all this happens right under their noses aur jab sale bhag jate toh randi rona karte privatize the profits and socialize the lossescorruption is real but imo the revenue you re talking about is already reserved for different portfolios in the annual budget health care is one of them but no country considers pandemic natural calamity while formulating the budget thus some extra funds that the public provides in the prospect of these pm and cm relief funds always helps also it always one personal choice to donate or not and believe nobody should really have problem with it just don donate anything into the begging bowlyou mad bro taxes are for corrupt contractors and friends family of politicians to loot this is for something else entirely top of that pm funds is not transparent at all there are only people who will be controlling these funds modi amit and sitaraman with no accountability it can be easily misused request everyone to not donate there instead help in your local areas where you could see your funds utilized immediately or some good ngo who are feeding poor every day this is what have done waiting for bhakts to comment only indians pay taxes the government should make up its mind whether india is rich and swimming in money or if we re poor and desperately lacks funds if we are so poor why then waste tax money on statues and monuments why does the government spent s of crores on advertising the government also uses tax money as transaction fees on electoral bonds why destroy growth with pointless exercises like demonatisation how much growth in k has the government destroyed with the lockdown in k to the chutiya members of it cell who are coming here and downvoting this stuff bc it a crisis time people are asking question for your family only how fucking stupid do you have to be to mass downvote this stuff even now grow brain because we are highly overpopulated country reduce the population and most of the problems will get resolvedyou know it stems down to two things corruption and incompetence these two vices in our political system is killing any hopes of progress this is why haven given dime to this so called pm cares fund government of india is rich af they just need to keep their priorities right first of all you should understand that the of people paying taxes in this country is very small crore individuals people were among those who filed returns in compare that with our general population which is crore which is of the total population of course you have companies firms and other entities which pay tax apart from individuals which adds to the overall taxes collected but still the number is very very small you should understand that these are the people and entities who opted to file and or pay tax you still have large portion who make money and don pay taxes for obvious reasons this is one of the reasons why the govt has indirect taxes in place meaning you pay tax on almost everything you buy whether is pack of cigarettes to car to phones etc the govt needs money to run the country as it incurs expenses for variety of things administrative costs cost for building and maintaining infrastructre healthcare govt schemes etc the problem here is two fold lot of people and entities withhold their incomes and don pay tax and whatever tax is collected by the govt is not used properly for it intended purpose due to corruption so when people like you or me who pay taxes on time obviously do not get what we pay for from basic proper roads to effective crisis management so in essence in system that inherently bad only the bad will win the good is seen as an anomaly or even as hindrance so while we pay taxes on time as we are morally obliged and to avoid being hounded by the it dept the people who don pay taxes and the politician who swindles tax money in the name of executing public projects are the real winners xb edit cr of crore is haan haan can do math for nuts to protect jumlabaaz tadipar pisht etc gangs government spends crores to build aadhaar scam infrastructure government wasted billion dollars of tax payers money they spend crores on adverting their accomplishments foreign trips budget may also be crores they spend crores for trading mps mlas etc they are very extravagant in spending tax payer money they spend it on free schemes maybe because most indians try tooth and nail to evade taxes and during crisis the government can actually guilt trip them into coughing up some money although d guess it still the salaried folk making more individual donations but can blame the government for trying they have funds to make statues hence don trust pm fund at all that too via paytm it a feature and not bug of the socialist republic of india the tax money was spent on statues foreign trips it strange cause no one knows where the money is going too and the taxpayers money is used on ads and building giant statues didn donatedmalya and modi took most of the money remaining money feel is distributed between political parties we can say that they are spending money for illicit purposes but the taxes we levy won be enough to take care of our huge population tax collected last year lakh crores country population crores spendable amount per capita enjoy this think can qualify as good rant observations our standards and revenue being exposed to lot of western media our standards have gone up rightly so we however forget that the western countries do collect very high level of taxes in very effective way am against demonetization gst and it botched implementation however we do all have to agree that our standards expectations do not line up with the macroeconomic fiscal financial efficiency ineffective disbursement the taxes that the government does collect get disbursed and deployed very ineffectively there is political bias populist bias corruption transparency issues precedent judiciary law enforcement is weak overall ineffective priorities the priorities shift quite rapidly too sometimes they become business first then defense first then welfare first then politicians first pun intended they are however never consistently about education healthcare science and development social welfare etc the illiterate executive well if your hrd minister believes in mythical conspiracies your health minister in the prowess of cow dung and your welfare minister is not even qualified you have perfect mess on hand the pm himself can fully explain his qualifications except for chai pakoda gareeb and patriotic anywho it always comes down to it is not about what the country can do for me it is always about what can do for the country if you feel pm cares doesn sit well with your conscience do your own thing do it in the name of your human empathetic self else just sit home watch netflix and chill meanwhile they give away of india medicines to the white man for free so that they can kiss ass and get pat on the head from trump and his white nationalist crowd nri here you guys don pay enough tax we pay income tax on top we pay shit ton of other taxes believe me you guys don well the portion of country that pays taxes is small sliver almost most people who are not salaried employess don pay close to what they should as taxestaxes are not only for the time of pandemic if you open your eyes and see what the government does then you will be surprised to see that there are many essential things which the government has made and guess you are one of those people who cry for unity and peace and brotherhood amongst the citizen of the country so why are you not willing to pay for your brother who are in need of those funds right now people in every country pay taxes and this is the time every government all over the globe needs money to fight this crisis which has drastic impact on every country economy and people the crisis is huge which perhaps you and me cannot even image would suggest stop criticizing and start contributing how much money are you paying qs taxes am asking this reading your language as if you have paid crore of taxes and haven got enough and how many people pay taxes and what do you mean by the govt has come with begging bowl who has asked you for money hate people who use social media to just spread negativity especially in the moments of crisis like this and own no responsibility instead of always blaming the govt just because pay tax doesn mean am free from paying an income tax you have to understand that the taxation systems need everything to operate as intended to work all your countries with free health care have very high it taxes in addition to the sales taxes it is economically impossible to give all the benefits you ask in addition to the population and resources we have totally agree that our politicians are corrupt and eat up so much of what we get but you cannot compare countries like hongkong to india because it absurd because if population and resource perspective scandinavian countries canada and all those that provide free healthcare figure out what the common denominator in them now you are an anti national lol they cut day salary of every govt employee to raise fund during flood and other disaster and they collected money from govt employees during this outbreak too because people become hoarders and selfish themselves during every crisis you want more money circulating during crisis because circulation dips due to one time buys govt begs so to atleast make percentage of these chutiyas reduce their hoardings and donate some wealth into the economy all govts work in debt and these crisis are almost always unpredictable even with trillion dollars they can build maglev trains overnight government doesn get enuff money from taxes only

important op here a book for you hope it would help overcoming unwanted intrusive thoughts cbt based guide to getting over frightening obsessive or disturbing thoughts ok cc book amate im no doctor scientist or anything but are you sleeping alright like smooth hours of sleep every night hey op am not diagnosing but these intrusive thoughts are very common with ocd suggest you go to therapist or

recovered to the point where am well it takes time but is very doable you just need to be focused on your treatment first important thing stop doing drugs second important thing keep your mind busy know stepping out isn possible d suggest studying whatever you can get your hands on mathematics programming science will help more as they are mentally taxing and you won be able to zone out much

get out and gather in your respective balconies and do small cheerful act at least by seeing all others too in their respective balconies it gives sense of moral support to each one of us it like

why do we believe in god www reddit com india comments fxuzbv why do we believe in god the more reason and debate with myself the more lose the believe in god and religion my grandmother was asking the god why he is doing this current pandemic he has only created us and if he is going to make us suffer with this pandemic then why he created us this make my opinion strong that god has not created us we have created him to blame for our failures success sorrow and everything else which we can control because it is hard for lot of people to accept that everything is just randomness they have zero control on outside circumstances and life has no universal meaning just the individual meaning you get from it they need to hold onto the fact that someone something is in the driver seat of this giant rock hurtling through space it can be comfort and there nothing wrong with it until of course you start using it to control other people thoughts rights and actions believing in god gives people hope and with hope people achieve things that they never would have thought they could hope is strong feeling just thinking that everything is going to be alright and this too shall pass gives you the strength to tackle obstacles fear during my childhood and early teenage was devout beliver because was afraid of poor results ghosts death of near or dear one losing face among friends etc its about hope some people believe in it its their explanation of how the world came to be if you take it from them they will go into an existential dread notice the difference between people who commit suicide religious people are less likely to end their lives whereas the others are higher religion is about hope its great practice but nowadays its like mine is better than yours kill each other all that bad shit religion is also about discipline remember when you were kid your parents used to scare you about ghosts and shit just so you eat or go to sleep or keep quiet religion is kinda like that maybe its exaggerated tales of kings and queens and other people back in ancient times and over time it transformed into what it is now who knows maybe once we die we might know the truth if there is heaven hell of course parents enforce it on the next generation and so onif you ask me directly and you re someone who rational and open minded id say don believe in god if not ll just throw it out there saying somewhat believe it and avoid all the hassle of majority of the society ve been to religious events purely out of curiosity and my brain just couldn accept anything they were preaching almost purely brainwashing for brief sense of happiness and safety do have friends whose faith is strong as steel and won judge them they are living their lives without bothering others you believing not believing in god should not affect others sadly that considered as business around the world scummy one too rd point is said by carvaka च र व कmaby god is just ba comfort for many people to cling to most want something from god but for some people it just gives source of comfort suppose there is this factor in many muslims find very charming good or bad they tend to leave everything to god and believe it gives people strength to move and face shitstorms suppose and if people derived comfort from it we are no one to judge atheismindiato each his own it all fine as long as they abide by common law and stop enforcing their belief on others psychological stability don believe in god but know why people believe in god because they afraid of deatheither god doesn exist or he fuckin evil strongly believe in god the more read about science the more believe in him truly feel like am nothing without him and yes cannot prove it because that is something feel about god which is love don worship idols or images though read quote that just explains all these things in short don know the exact quote but it goes like it easier to fool someone than to explain him that he has been fooled sums it all up ve observed that mostly elders are more into gods the mighty plan and astrology think because they place their hopes on some being watching over them every other positive coincidental thing that happened to them reinforces their belief in the idea of gods astrology and they seldom question urban myths hate it when they just credit the gods for every little thing that goes right in their life also society plays part in all this too people want to be accepted too hence they dont oppose or think for themselves too have been thinking about this recently if you look at every world religion and their origin stories it seems like they were written by an idiot woman gets pregnant without having sex pair of animals in ship curses from mahabharata flying monkeys death to anyone who does not believe in this religion etc take few moments and look into all these stories with logic and you will be shocked at how little thinking went into these stories by the writers sala kuch ve likh doto create neutral common control mechanism of comparison of religious values so as to control people that cant be controlled by virtue of their actual skills talents and or brains religion gives dumb people an area to shine where they dont have to prove their worth on an intrinsic basis and thus can accumulate importance enough to control people with actual intrinsic value through social pressure or threat of being made an outsider that is the purpose of religion its value is personal and never has to be divulged between people for any mandatory reason god is time it is not an abstract entity kalo smi loka ksaya krt pravrddho time am destroyer of the worlds chapter the universal form text same reason people believe in politicians good pr and stupidity of people my theory is that nobody truly believes in god anymore they just believe in the religion glorifying that god and like the feeling of belonging to group reasons for this theory fundamental principles of every religion against lying hatred violence are being contradicted on daily basis these contradictions are ubiquitous if population truly believed in god and in the wrath of that god these contradictions

cricket in so much so don even know most of the new actors name you live off netflix prime and can avoid celebrity news like covid just stop watching news high percentage of people won understand situation until it happens to them r coz most people dont listen to docters but celebrities instead they need screen time somehow or the other other wise it goes this way out of sight out of mind out of job that because you click on those and keep getting suggested similar stuff stop watching bollywood news if you don want them being suggested to you which news do you read in my highly customized twitter list feed dont get all these timeless chappelle bit about op rant youtu be hbhjg c dude m so self quarantined m not even watching the news just check covidindia org for the latest numbers google coronavirus news to see if they have extended the lockdown and then go read book just stay off the news you ll feel better we can do anything about celebrity news because sadly lot of viewers still want to see it the moment the views go down they will not show it anymore m sick of it all they care is publicity and most don even give shit about th lockdown came across news article where of them got vip pass to gym because of lockdown shows their true colours don blame the media houses at all celebs sell as simple as that the media runs on advertising and advertising demands eyeballs we as consumers get what we deserve the only alternatives are either state run media which doesn depend on advertising or you put in the effort to curate your own news feed online bollywood can fuck off too soon we should boycott it altogether indian news anchors are buffoons when entire world is suffering from pandemic and there are other serious issues in the world they are busy gathering trp by playing antakshaari and showing what celebrities are up to in their expensive houses during the lock down but they are not one to be blamed there always demand even though the percentage might be small there are people who are interested in so called news things like these makes me question our human species over media is so bankrupt of news nowadays you are not alonethere are like only two things shown on news now days either it something related to covid or shitty interviews of home quarantined celebrities you are absolutely right and tbh think even the celebrities are sick of this everything is garbage make cocoon for yourself and live in it no m not sick of it because ignore it and scroll right past it so stop clicking those shitty clickbait links that the only way these chaddi media people are going to get it in india actors and cricketers are smarter than scientists engineers and doctors for the media many times have observed that the media also calls them intellectuals when their only degree is of th grade fuck that shit it is annoying as fuck and we don care about how big boss couples are spending their quarantine or how ranveer and deepika are spending their quarantine fun trick mark them as spam they will stop showing up in your feed and reduce the reach of those posts thus lead to less clicks leading to less posts cause people listen to them why else do you see so many of them in tv ads mass influence they are nothing but ad campaigns in the form of articles paid for by these celebs marketing teams and benefit both parties the news apps get their clicks and ad revenue and the celebs especially the younger generation say the khan kids get exposure among the public what these young celebrities lack for in acting talent and good films they try to make up for by shoving their pictures and names down your throat again and again basically anything they can do to increase fan following and get you to watch their next shitty movie remember last year toi did new article on sara ali khan for days straight yeah counted fml obviously paid for by her parents to get her publicity toi is the most guilty of this since these bastards mix their paid ads in between every real news articles whereas some like ndtv have an entire section which you can just ignore over time ve learnt to ignore and just step around them like do for cow or bird shit anyone else cringed to this youtu be wh srmtwgtwit annoying when big news channels in spite of giving meaningful news stories give out insignificant news about the celebrities lives especially in this time of crisis like what celebrities do in their free time the news channels who broadcast such news betray their viewers from this feeling of being called news channel was watching news channel the other day where they were showing how katrina kaif is trying her hands at washing dishes these days like how is it important at all and what happened if she washed dishes aren celebrities human like us did it change anything if she washed dishes india is very celebrity obsessed didn realize it as much when lived there but ever since moving abroad every time visit home it hits me like brick newspapers social media advertisements on tv hoardings on the highway page of bombay times the rest of bombay times it just continuous nonstop celebrity worship so m not surprised at all that even this pandemic is seen through the lens of media personalities it probably due to escapism most of the film non art in the world show average person living am outlandish life for example the in friends tv shows how do those people get to afford such fancy apartment in new york it all about escapising our griefs and mindless entertainment the other aspect being that without govt funding the only way to generate revenue for media is through clickbait which feeds advertising they have no better jobs than market themselves no don get any news like that as over the years have pressed not interested in celebrity name now google doesn bother be with those whatever keeps them away from doing hindu muslim supportthese celebs getting special permission from home ministry during lock down so that they can travel to there farm houses and stay there entire period there because you are all nothing more than slaves and you can do anything about it this is just old and perfect trick to divert our mind that why don read newspaper or watch news it much peaceful dude let them do it or they will go will back to blaming this on muslimsi could not agree more aggressively with post here ever totally mean really do not care now what they are doing or not doing we dont need these videos we need information what is the next plan where is the pm fund being directed agree that while celeb videos take the pressure off it really isnt that feasible in the lomg term think it their narcissism living under constant media focus paid or unpaid and suddenly being ripped of all that glare is making them desperate for limelight no matter how petty it seems they are yearning for attention lot was never fan of celebrities outside movies because people give too much attention to them and they literally do stuff to grab attention appreciate them giving funds for pm cares and any such good things they do but not the oh look he she do this news videos only news on my regional language channels is about corona no politics no accidents no nothing people are watching them non stop and feeding their anxiety without even realizing it also think this is the only time celebrities actually spent time at home for days you know ve been noticing this change over the past years or so the top news section in most apps on most websites news channels is practically littered with puff pieces about celebrities and their personal lives get the feeling that this is what most people around us prefer reading it horrible really was sick of this even before lockdownpeople follow celebrities more than doctors and celebrities are also spreading awarenesseveryime open times of india page it always shw some pics of some actor or their family what is the use of this for us people dont knowindian news media golirifies their celebs like they are the gods its not new its just cash cow being milked the fact that this gets more upvotes than any other meaningful post should answer the question am always upset about telling me what celebrities are up to don care what you ate for breakfast kareenaabsolutely humans have greed to know and acquire things they don need honestly when it has come to this pandemic that threatens all of us if even under those circumstances we insist on enhancing and elevating narcissists and insist on staring at worthless useless shiny things maybe we just deserve to die out think it interesting to some people to see that such famous stars as they call them too are normal just like everyone else when put under the same circumstance lol look at people fawning over katrina kaif doing dishes as they sit on the couch with their feet up without even bothering to take their own utensils to the kitchen while their mother washes them but yeah m definitely not interested in it watched this asian boss video on youtube it was south korean doctor talking about the coronavirus and talking about all that south korea did to become the first nation to mostly eradicate the virus and can believe they didn show this on the news like they show all kinds of viral shit in some news flashes like why cant you show one thing that can actually calm the people down and inform them there a variety of news on tv for most of the day they re gonna talk about the crisis in general and how many cases are there and what to come and stuff like that but for some of the day they would talk to celebrities about what they re up to it not done excessively don think there a huge problem with it how much news about the virus are they gonna keep repeating all day don see the huge deal with it you can choose to not watch it m talking mainly about tv news they can stand not having attention x man they ll create more ruckus than corona to stay in the limelighti have trick stop following the fucking newsi don give shit about what celebrities are up to even in the normal days celebrity worship is the norm in our country people die to listen to their opinion on political matters regional or international disputes pandemics ffs they re all illiterate fucks who happen to be well connected or good looking we as country need to start valuing and respecting the people who matter ask the experts in the field about issues and not obsess over miss england becoming doctor or what fucking anurag kashyap has to shit mouth about hacen watched newslooks like you have subscribed to times of indiashahrukh gave one more flop movie this is beyond ridiculousdon we have instagram and youtube to know what celebrities are doingas sick as am hearing about the terrifying rise of crazy hindu nationalists and gang rapes mean there a market for that trp matters and it provides some variety too just my cents mean if news channels want to leak some celebrity sex tapes to help through quarantine be my guest otherwise these channels got ligma shoving some pab mopping floor in my facethat is the only news that is available these days everyone wants to know what their favourite celebrity is up to that just how mainstream media works if you really want to help then don click or watch those videos try and create more awareness or make stories popular that talk about doctors media only gives you what you want or at least what majority of the people want well would rather see that then the blatant communal bullshit ek ganna ho jaye corona par general celebrity reporting is just low tier journalism created for clickbait and catering to to the lowest common denominator with too much time on their handsmay be they are making images for shutterstockcelebrities do lot of things they do it to keep them and others entertained it their job you can choose to see something else fyi don watch anything about celebrities what they are doing outside their profession like koffee with karan bigboss etc it complete time of waste if you watch them of daily basis what else shall they do come up with sensible questions like why doctors are not getting quality ppe even after all the donations received organise standard debates rather than big boss show not their cup of tea on the other side it is hard to see how wildly people are interested on those celebrities who can do anything for their monetary gainstop following mainstream media don if it really important you ll hear it see it somehow m from india and don have any celebrities in india and yeah hate it we are in those times where the credibility of the media which is also said to be the th pillar of the constitution in under heavy doubts and then there are these such trashy news which doesnt even comes under real reporting just want to know do we have colleges or university that actually teach the difference between real news and no news idk what type of site mensxp is all about they report shitty news and for some reason facebook keeps promoting itwould rather see not real news which features photo of good looking person or read real news created caused by mad ugly people meyeah why should we be giving them much attention nowadays that true and this is phenomenon that indian journalism needs to distance itself from unfortunately most media houses are not the most daring when it comes to covering news in addition to that reporters either lack the motivation or the guidance also conscience to cover news that matter if you have noticed most of these news channels are based out in the metropolitan cities and the stories they cover are within certain radius and similarly most of the regional news channels are trapped in their own rabbit hole and fail to spread their reach again if we look at these regional reporters they are paid very less compared to the metropolitan scribes and just to fill their daily quota they do stories on trivial issues and that is where lies the true struggle of the news person and turn themselves into tabloid journalists engaged in celebrity news as most of those are pr stunts events and making news stories out of tweets of xyz celebrities and failed politicians but then again there is section of audience who find these newsworthy but about that we can have another post celebrities and modi mom bothindian media sucks ass everyone knows that wanna know what sunny is upto these days that how they sugarcoat the problems and tame the masses celebrity gossip muslim conspiracy pick one nothing is left after praising government and abusing pakistan what else can they sell election ho ya riot cinema ho ya quarantine sab trp ka race hain media ke liye tihadi sudhir chaudharyyeah they will be fine media should focus on people who are most affected by the epidemic like migrant workers or homeless people journalism has become joke now yes am sick of it please stop sharing those on reddit headline of

opportunity to local folk arts theater artist to flourish as people main direct day resources toward such artists focus of the news channel and the nation may be toword the more important issues celebs live off public opinion and reputation basically publicity and big ass digital marketing team is behind all that look at what celebrity is upto as you see film making isn happening rn and peeps gotta prepare for post lockdown opportunities so missing any chance of publicity is bad this actually happens at daily basis but due to the fact that you can only do so much during the course of the lockdown is kinda showing this system of forced social marketing even the stuff about celebs involved in movie somehow start dating is mostly fluff aimed at milking the jodi and making many movies whilst people want to see their chemistry just turned off most of my exposure to this as imo its all forced positivity at the end of the day which can make ones life miserable if not taken in limited amountsdo you still watch tv news left it years back and moved towards text based more sensible content like livemint at the moment there only so much corona news you can take there corona everywhere and you watching the news ain going to improve the situation stay away from that and stay positive news channels too are experimenting with their content keeping in mind the trp thing they are supposed to be on page but they are on page and in bold who wants to know how medical staff is working or how essential workers like garbage collector is risking his her life so that we can live yup that why blocked hindustan timesdo consider watching lallantop news on youtube one of the most unbiased and no bullshit news you might find tonedeafcelebs worth look thenpleasing masses since centuries am sick of celebrities per se sometimes imagine viral bhayani wanting to suck his own dick he totally jobless right now it a form of escapism people look at the luxurious exciting lives they lead and it provides distraction for the numbing humdrum existence most regular people live with there are better ways to distract ourselves of course but this is low effort antakshari and this suck

policy iran had high mortality consistent with the idea that bcg protects the vaccinated elderly population www medrxiv org content v india started mass bcg immunisation in this is not definite proof but something we can be optimistic about another theory is the hygiene hypothesis lot of complications from covid like arsd are not caused by the virus but body own immune response the theory is that

hate to say it but each other all we gotreligion is the main cause of unrest in india religion is one intense fandom deleted religion is legalised madness edit thank you for the shining silver kind stranger to all those parents and students who called moral science classes sham this is why we needed it religion is an expired product that has continued to stay it should have been eradicated or died while back but has not if we as species have to reach next level then we need to get over religion any existing religion is like superman did wonders on paper but doesn actually exists when you call yourself an indian or muslim or christian or european or anything else you are being violent do you see why it is violent because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind when you separate yourself by belief by nationality by tradition it breeds violence so man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country to any religion to any political party or partial system he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind jiddu krishnamurti questioner kindly give straight reply does god exist or not yes or no if yes how best to realize him in this life jk if you examine very closely you have created god right in india there are about was told there are about gods and more laughs you understand every local person has his own god so sirs we have created god see the irony of it thought has created god and then thought worships the image which thought has created which is to worship oneself and call it god you understand all this the better part of you is god right wonder if you understand this first of all let be clear have you created god the local gods round the corner or the local god in rome or in tirupati or wherever you have created them haven you you are so very uncertain aren you so frightened if you say we have created then you are scared stiff because you have created out of your fear that out of your fear you want security right you want safety you want to feel there is somebody looking after you because you are afraid you follow so you create that and then worship that just see what you are doing going to tirupati and putting all your money in the bag do you think gods want your money sir look at it all you have nothing to offer but money garlands prostrations rituals right you have nothing else to offer have you realised the tragedy of this sirs if you love not god that very easy to love god because it is an abstraction it has not much meaning but if you love that very love is god that very love is sacred you won go outside to look for god you understand all this sirs and the questioner wants to know if believe in god don because god is something created by man there is such thing as eternity which is to be outside of time right sir for that you must have mind heart that is completely free from all the burdens of life right from your vanity your arrogance your selfishness you follow sir and we say we are not capable of it tell us what to do you are back in the cycle somebody to tell you what to do sir you are in jungle you have to walk through it by yourself right and for that you need vitality and vigour and strength not belief in god in goodness belief has no place where truth is concerned right if you need divine reward to do something good or you have fear if you do something bad something bad will happen think your are piece of shit just be kind to the people help them if you can and for the world sake stop protecting your religion this post is pure gold religion destroys humanity not build it all cast system racism homophobia and misogynims have their roots in religion just fuck religion and you ll bring out the best in humans god is like that baba we use to scare kids with so they won do anything that is denied reads title ahhh see you are man of culture as wellit really my imaginary friend is so much better than yours we re not going to get blown out in supernova the sun too little religion is massive waste of time it has outlived it utility this is why believe in my made up god dovah dragon from skyrimi personally believe that religion is for those weak minded people who can face the music and always need some kind of support was one of them there was this really nice quote from mib an individual is smart person perfectly capable of making his own decisions rational etc but crowd on the other hand is violent easy to provoke and has nothing but common herd mentality now don get me wrong do read sometime bits and pieces of religious text which are some really well thought out philosophical texts but let us be real there always be motherfucker who gonna distort everything and use gullible people to support his own propaganda by exploiting their concept of belief so preach father and preach it hard fucking hell fuck all religions all they have ever done is divided us and taken advantage of by opportunistic old politicians and our childish adults should take as much blame for that we re literally standing on the verge of global environmental collapse with highest levels of inequality and unemployment with massively flawed education system and all they can talk about is their mandirs and masjids with no regard for what the future generations would go through this this right here fuckkk all religion the bane of mankindnot just religion any ideology that overtakes your identity as human being is dangerous be it the religious wars that were fought to the dictators who mass murdered people in keeping to their beliefs everywhere people collectively stood behind an ideology that shadowed their human identity don believe in ideologies rather believe and hope that tomorrow when mob of these f king ts come to lynch you there ll be atleast one amongst them questioning what he doing and changes his mind about his beliefs or if you are privileged enough you could just live in harmony clapping and cheering watching while these ts kill themselves sremove religion from schools prayers and we have chance at better futurei am going through same frustration bro where are the so called foking almighty god who are immortal or are they the ones doing this them fok them guys tell me one benefit in believing in religion does it save from these riots which is happening in the name of it does it make people disciplined then who are these goons who are killing in the name of religion guess it was just an fiction story written by man and later after centuries people started thinking it as thier past and that it was all real just imagine after centuries if somehow someone reads marvel comics or harry potter or any such fiction story and actually believe in them thinking it as real thing from past wish people one day no longer believes in it man made god not the other way around religion is like penis imgur com vgtsio jpg we can ban religions but we should start banning religion backed schools madarshasfuck god m better without it all we are to them are just paying fanboys of their poorly written scifi franchise mr rbot about religion wanted to gift an award but m poor very well written have the same ideology hope so people stop this mass brutality in the name of religion it wouldn have been real problem if everyone minded their own bussiness nothing divides us except religion are you sure about that religion is way for humans to escape reality it makes people feel as if they are part of something bigger in reality they are nothing and they cant accept that its way too easy to think they are part of god plan rather than blob of hydrocarbons religion is just theory that was believed for so long that when better theories which proved religion false came along people couldnt accept it wrong sub my man most in this sub are sensible enough to know this should probably post it somewhere where people are deluded people who are using incendiary rhetoric and inciting violence to meet their agenda are not in this sub the intricate reality of these cults are far more complex to find universal solution for now than saying fuck all religion on the internet religions will fade away it will take time though until then it what it is if it wasn for religion it would be caste or nationalism for some reason being human isnt enough and we feel need to form smaller communities haven come up with what possible solution looks like but at the least it should include critical thinking in kids and stopping religious indoctrinationthere is no better way to make people who have no beef in the first place hate each other to the point of committing genocide than through religion religion is just flawed philosophy there is nothing special in it religion is mental illness why on earth would want to associate with them blech let them kill each other and some day they ll all be gone www bbc com future article tomorrows gods what is the future of religion read this article india hindu muslim hindu muslim hindu muslim hindu muslim rest of the world fighting with coronavirus religion is the opium of the masses forget about the bloody gods and listen to what am telling you margery tyrella hallucinatic person said something about religion which made so much sense to me if don believe in my imagenary friend why the hell should believe in yours elliot andersongood rant could not agree more my hats off to my indian brothers and sisters in the struggle against the zealotskeep spreading the truth let turn all religions into mythology again religion was invented by smart rulers to control dumb people and its something that sadly never going to change when you teach child something the older they get the harder it is for you to change their mind and when they have kids of their own they teach them the same thing and it becomes an amplification loop we live in world where people take incredible luxuries for granted because thats what we re born with the modern world allows dumb people to be loud and grab the attention of other dumb people who think the same something that was never possible before for god sake just look at all the anti science movements you can calculate the speed of light using microwave and chocolate bar but if they don believe it it doesn exist people who think this way dont want to know the truth they want what they think is the truth to be the truth and when that line of thinking combines with conflicting opinions all hell breaks loose careful not to cut yourself on all that edge disclaimer first am an atheist having said that the problem isn religion in and of itself most religious teachings usually boil down to care about others and be decent person yes there a lot of fucked up stuff in the texts as well not denying that but lot of people find comfort and strength in their beliefs and you saying they should just let go of it because it illogical and dumb is frankly as intolerant as religious fanatics religion also does not have to be at odds with science and learning remember asking religion teacher in school which is correct the big bang or god made the world she told me both the big bang happened but god made it happen obvs not something believe but not the point is she also reiterated that the bible is not literal and she was nun and as you may have heard einstein believed in god too so again it possible for both religion and scientific knowledge to coexist organised religion is absolutely problem in my transition from roman catholic to atheist had i believe in god but not in the church phase religious organisations can be corrupt to the core people twisting scriptures and teachings to suit their own agendas of hate and power are problem people using religion to support ignorance and prejudice that harms others like being against the lgbtq community or anti vaxxers or sects who believe medical intervention should not be allowed are problem but religious people who use religion to find personal comfort help others and be part of community there is nothing wrong with that yes still believe the world would be better off without religion because of all of the people who exploit it and do so much harm in its name but it is not my or your or anyone place to dictate to someone what they should or should not believe in if they are not harming you in any way and just living their life peacefully because again if you do this it makes you no better than religious nuts who want to dictate how we live our lives amenstop talking sense true fuck religionthank god m an atheist yes all religions are fairy tales yes no religion has any definitive proof of being true but there is one point people here are missing religion does give people mental peace and purpose to live especially when things are not going their way while it gives people false sense of hope that makes them believe that things will get better it does keep them resilient during tough times people want easy answers to questions and religion gives it to them we may be rational in thinking that we can embrace tough times by just moving forward and waiting for things to become better but others are not they can easily get depressed and go through mental problems people who derive pride from their religion go too far to solve that they need to be educated and given fulfilling work this won stop them from being religious but it will at least give them genuine reason to be proud if you want to do away with religion you need to first solve mental health problems just my cents exactly and fuck nationalism none of us chose these lives bodies that we are living in neither did the person you hate choose this life for himself borders were created by us and it something very abstract fighting and killing others for something like this seems very stupid to me imagine how far humanity would have been if they set aside all these differences i wish could do science experiment with religious people in one country agnostic atheist in another country then would like to measure several parameters gdp income freedom of speech etc am really curious what the results will be it always been way to control people it can be argued that it brought many people together in the good ol days the world wasn so much connected back then your entire life would be spent in km radius where it would be rare to find someone who believes in different imaginary being so it brought everyone together by believing things larger than themselves but the in last century since everyone is so connected finding person who believes in some other imaginary being is too easy and that where the human group psychology acts against us and forms groups it becomes us vs them religion is unnecessary in our society but don think it should be irradiated or banned think the ideal way to deal with this would be to just keep what metaphysical thing you believe in to yourself yesthis is why thanos was right wait till you hear about capitalism classismimagine being an adult who holds faith in their omnipotent imaginary friend as described in thrice translated collection of oral histories collected over years ago regarding events that happened hundreds of years before they were written down you know the inuit believe that the earth was created by raven the difference know ravens exist post this on chintu sub and witness the dislikesyesss fuck them fuck all of them every fucking government form ve ever filled asks for my religion be it university or public sector job despise the idea that my belief system is somehow relevant to my performance as student or as an employee make it point to write a in that section no matter what the repercussions iirc once public college even asked my caste ffs my caste and no not from reservation point of view just under personal information religion is nothing but tool to control large number of people by the people in power or those who pretend to be the representative of the religion it was used by hitler to justify the heinous crime even tho no sane mind would agree this level of torture for fellow human it was used by evangelist christian europeans who plundered lands of other descredited their culture along with subjecting them to discrimination it was used by isis fighter who were so islamic that they made burkha mandatory for all woman in their area came with motto to defend islam but themselves raped in every village they went even killing fellow muslims it is now being used by the rss bjp to polarise the people antagonize the whole muslim community on pretext of ages old of their own made up history encouraging lynchings through bajrang dals inciting violence it is still being used by few godmen who even with rape charges against them property worth of s of crore people support them blindly anybody even dare to criticize them is declared the enemy of the whole community feel you man im gonna start college this year and am really afraid to go to delhi to study all it would take is one person to accuse someone of being hindu or muslim for bloodbath that to start that police will probably ignorei truly believe in the not too distant future that the belief of religion will be classified as mental illness it crazy to me that when you go back and read some of the different religious texts it chock full of holes and usually rely on prophets speaking having visions of insert deity here to get the message across that shit sounds like textbook schizophrenia but because no one knew what that was they just accepted it as truth now here we are thousands of years later millions killed in the name of religion and people still believe this bullshit sorts by controversial grabs popcorn fellow atheist popping in as ve said before if god does exist he doesnt deserve our worship because of the unnecessary suffering this donkey allows in his name or without god either shape up and help or fuck the right off religion is like having dick it fine to have one but it not ok to shove into other people especially children m agnostic and dislike all religions but this reads like it belongs to iamverysmart or iamandthisisdeeplet get this straight there are lot of things that divide us other than religion it is in our nature to do it religion is not bad it believing that your religion is better than all the others or your god is superior to the other gods is what is the problem am not religious and agree with you on most points want to believe that the abolishment of all religions is the answer to most of the problems of humanity but here is thought what about the countries with the most non religious people china czech uk can we really say they are perfect china has of people who are non believers can we really say they are in better state than us religion is problem but maybe the bigger problem is basic human nature which is to be selfish and divisive yes buddy the problem is religion not corruption theft incompetence maladministration colonial laws red tape power cuts absence of health care undrinkable water no water rabies typhoid malaria dengue pm unlivable cities unsustainable cost of living ridiculous salaries sewage in the water inability of the state and judicial system to catch or punish any kind of criminal at any level all of which lead to the majority of people living in permanent state of despair no the only problem is religion let get rid of that and everything will be perfect great solution of course you are right nice work now go cure cancer d if god does exist he is having laughing riot now and yeah fuck religion bruh so edgy wow fuck christian christian well hello if the concept of god has any validity or any use it can only be to make us larger freer and more loving if god cannot do this then it is time we got rid of him james baldwin faith in god is the purposeful suspension of critical thinking bill maheralso fuck moashi do not believe in any god whatsoever but do believe that if people want to they should if something provides them with an anchor sense of relief then why force them out of it but of course agree with your point of mass killings due to religion and d also like to add to it that the concept of religion has been major hindrance in our development as well all in all m just saying if people want to practice religion they should but they should be accepting of other religions and learn to live in peace do not believe in this modern world commercial religion shit and have distanced myself from religion since years now the thing is it doesn matter in india used to live in gurgaon and was asked my name numerous times even in front of my house by random people who then started fighting non verbal fights with me just because its persian name live in toronto now and noone gives shit about your religion here unless you decide to live in indian pakistani bangladeshi ghettos again the thing is it doesn matter what your faith or philosophy is when the crowd of fanatics comes at your door they will kill you there is no reason with these people and to be honest its more related to the wealth gap between rich and poor the poor have rage in them they have cell phones with cheap internet and big families with nothing to do so in their mind power is in numbers and force is only way to get things done seriously fuck this society edit wordlol looks like somebody just figured it outno matter how peaceful your religion is the world will never be in peace with religion in it religion is the most dangerous disease weapon and mental illness in this world the main cause behind most wars look at world war ii nazis were predominantly christians hated jews for killing their lord thank you for this post redditmomentmy opinion on religion it was created to control the people while watching the hindu nationalists go insane in india this is all can think about we have to kill religion pakistani here we really are in shock over what has started happening we send our thoughts and prayers for all of you m already an athiest who promotes humanity more than anything all religions tell you to do better to gods or entities creation first this is just ungodly and non human violence hope this ends soon hope people get out safeone day religion will die off and humanity will be free from its lies religion is the biggest con everfinally someone who makes sense also agree that the religion and the caste system is absolute bullshithere is the really amazing speech from mr robot questioning religion is that what god does he helps tell me why didn god help my innocent friend who died for no reason while the guilty ran free okay fine forget the one offs how about the countless wars declared in his name okay fine let skip the random meaningless murder for second shall we how about the racist sexist phobia soup we ve all been drowning in because of him and m not just talking about jesus m talking about all organized religion exclusive groups created to manage control dealer getting people hooked on the drug of hope his followers nothing but addicts who want their hit of bullshit to keep their dopamine of ignorance addicts afraid to believe the truth that there no order there no power that all religions are just metastasizing mind worms meant to divide us so it easier to rule us by the charlatans that wanna run us all we are to them are paying fanboys of their poorly written sci fi franchise if don listen to my imaginary friend why the fuck should listen to yours people think their worship some key to happiness that just how he owns you even m not crazy enough to believe that distortion of reality so fuck god he not good enough scapegoat for me elliot alderson mr robot season episode agree my parents hindus always said that must pray to god every day and shit like that but honestly didn think there was any sense in that even in my school assemblies when everyone would vow their heads in prayer went to christian school would just stand there with my head up never felt that there was any use of prayer ameni o and am sure can live without your fairytale call it bragging but m just gonna go ahead and consider myself much better than majority of adult population am also vegan have questioned my life far and wide and think everyone should go through the process of self evaluation please do it do it for us the future generations this entire thread is huge redditmoment lmaoreligion makes many people look at eachother as sub humans we dont matter in the grand scheme of things but it is worth it to be good to eachother to protect the little we have religion causes so much pain and harm to innocent families don hate religious people at all understand why some people believe but its just fact the world would be better place without it even satanists thesatanictemple com pages tenetsatheists are just people who admit we don know how the universe works but we believe scientists are closer to the answers to the universe than the priests are ve never understood the mental gymnastics some of you religious apes use to justify your beliefs have highly educated intelligent family members who believe in all the fucking cultural pseudoscience atheism isn a choice it a symptom of functioning brain amazing tell others to be open minded then ask them to live exactly the way you want them too fuck you toovalid points but my religion has helped me become better person treat others with respect regardless of their religion and the colour of their skin give charity be productive member of the society and most of all it gives me hope the problem is not religion its extremism religious people are literally patients of brainwashing cult that has incepted anti human idea and tradition in their brainall right it time to address the usual rebuttals we need religion for emotional and spiritual values you can hire therapist for emotional support and simply buy good telescope to look at the night sky nothing is more spiritual than gazing at clear night sky in th century more people died by nazis and commies who were atheists nazis were not atheists they were christians who traditionally hated jews even the protestants hate jews just look into martin luther verses communists were atheists but weren just entirely atheists its the classic saying communist can be an atheist but not all atheists are communist especially proletarian dictatorship you cannot ignore the good things that religious people do you can do good things without being religious there this thing called humanity you know being an atheist doesn mean you re good person precisely the point atheism is simply an absence of belief in god and doesn explain anything about person political or social inclinations there were and are many bad atheists but unlike theist folks an atheist doesn need to defend that evil person merely because they share that one specific philosophy you cannot just remove religion like it does nothing that true religion does offer many good things but as said earlier you can offer all those good things without invoking an omnipotent omnipresent and omniscient god atheists are just too arrogant theists claim to know the mind of the omnipotent being which created this entire universe and yet atheists are the arrogant ones right religion and atheism are incompatible not entirely true it depends on one definition of religion if religion doesn need god as criterion then technically you can be an atheist and be part of religion again atheism only means the absence of belief in god nothing more nothing less ameni think we re stuck between fake left wing that just wants to appease minorities and rightwing that wants to install tyranny of the majority when the constitution clearly wants us to put aside the religious differences and want common good for everyone don think we people are not ready yet to think in such higher terms after all these years since we said our good byes to british we only inherited the golden divide and rule policy to keep people invested in their religious sentiments and derive political and economic returns from them don see near future where people can see through shit and have true democracy it sad but it also painful truth chinese are atheists and look at their treatment of uighurs tibetans hongkong taiwan etc religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature the heart of heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions it is the opium of the people by marxwell you know what they say religion is the opium of the masses personally vibe the concept of faith and can definitely see why people would be drawn to belief be it imaginary or not to sustain thoughts of afterlife and greater existence however hate the concept of religion as an institution religion has become an institution to control and generate profits and set its own agenda its an archaic institution that isn needed in the st centuryʻoumuamua take me away from this planetyou should check out anti theism btw totally agreeing with every single letter couldn say it any better then this fuck hinduism islam christianity and their other spin offs yes pleaseif you don want to accept death that fine focus your efforts on achieving immortality decide that you will live forever or die trying but don be dumb enough to believe in something that doesn translate whatsoever to reality most people on here would already be atheists so there no point preaching but just want to say that the world has far more to offer than religion will have you belief and this isn some short trip in grand journey this is the grand journey do good without thinking of consequences and without shedding blood for any divine powers if there are just gods then they would be pleased with you if there are no gods then you have made the world little better nonetheless if your gods are displeased because you didn worship and slaughter for them then they are petty and cruel and not worthy of being called gods anyway can explain how similar feel with your thoughtsamen to thatyea exactly think india should have religion or no religion column join atheismindiawow have always been closete,
 agnostic didn think there were many people in india with the same mindset on seeing the reaction and comments here am relieved hey look an atheist on reddit up next bigot from bjp so true take my fucking upvote you only realized this now religion is the best tools for power mongers and you know it another use yeah you guessed it right fool the foolish flock that the irony of religion long long ago people settled in groups made their own cultures lifestyles and called it as religion to bring them closer now the same religion is being used to make people apart sad part is many can see it religion is the opiate of the masses aristotle maybereligion is just some really good fiction with very toxic fanbasei hear you also eloquently expressed by carl sagan in the pale blue dot www youtube com watch wuptoqzeg finally the post was waiting for looks like people are starting to realize the true evil are the religion am getting out of these things lately religion at best are just fandoms and should not be given any importance in real life situations fuck all humans worst beings on earth have to say like the singing and the dancing from whatever religion but for the rest completely agree religion imo is nothing but mass control people do not fucking respect religion we are fucking scared from it human itself is the scourge of humanity have seen the good and bad things religions can do to people so see your point but not necessarily couldn agree with you more im not that religious anyways and you seem to have good point religion is the main cause of unrest here and if people don pay so much attention to it the unrest might stop human is above all religion lets practice humanity in harmony make the world better placei see you are man of culture intelligence as well edit ve had my share of participation in atheist groups on the net sadly most of them are filled with people who don know the difference between atheism and agnosticism atheismreligion were made to bring people together in harmony to share each other thoughts to help others out in need of help but lately due to sheer greed of basic human nature religion has become tool to control the masses and incite hate and violence against others who don follow same ideology nice post thanks for sharinggeorge carlin always had it right www youtube com watch r endstue www youtube com watch r endstue everyday m constantly reminded that prayers are the single most useless invention of humankind there is only one god timei see that you re man of logic op just joined happy to see more people with common sense the only thing religion does anymore is give us more artificial reasons to divide ourselves into tribes and hate each other couldn agree more amen to that relevant mr robot monologue youtu be ncenukbjq death to all fanatics hey if you read history god is one of the leading causes of death has been for thousands of years george carlini hate it more than you all do lol cheersfuck atheism how do you feel now this is exactly how people with religious belief feel after reading this am athiest myself dude just the first sentences were enoughi hindu chill with my gods and am with you it not about being from certain religion it about an individual willingness to not take himself so fucking seriously sit down and contemplate his mad life who else have watched man from the earth religion is how you can trick people into giving you their life religion is the tool used to exploit the masses don worry this life is just test run actually the more you suffer in this life the more god loves you the more he can hook it up in the next life now give me tax free money please bonus points if you slay some infidel have pretty strong feelings about orgasm maybe thats what life is about perpetual orgasm religion used to bring people together back in the ancient times to common mindset so that they can be together trust each other and work and discover invent new things and develop various technologies it used to unite people for greater things but nowadays the amount of toxicity and hate spreading through religion is immense religion is dividing people than brigining them together kinda ironic to its original purpose what about dudeism didn know there a sub for indian atheists lol m fan of indian atheists fb page they call out all relegion equally but ppl also get triggered when they oppose nrc and cab it amazes brahmin bhakths don understand they are standing up agsint discrimination not standing up for relegion also why is that our mythology of gods only ever mention animals that exists today why isn there god with dino as his vehicle coz they didn dig deep enough to find one and ppl who made yo these back then didn even know about pre historic animals think to yourself when one person suffers from delusion it is called insanity when many people suffer from delusion it is called religion robert pirsigi love uyeah fuck all religions people dying over made up stuff very cleverbut what currently happening in india is fascism using religion masks to divide people yup the good ol divide and conquer doubt is the highest form of intelligence religion should have no place in politicsall religions are man made and man is the effigy of mistakes xb hit up vote if you agree the statement here here thank god someone stepped up and spoken the truth the truth which matters the most in today modern world you deserve every upvote on this post as geroge carlin said the best and quote idiots fighting trying to prove to eachother whose imaginary friend has bigger dick m not sure if atheism is the only way it is good way to focus on the grand scheme of things but religion isn inherently wrong believe it changes are result of technological advancement while abandoning religion would work rebooting religion could also work only say this because religions actually never invoke any violence it the understanding of the people who practice it granted both are equally hard but consider religion such as the religious society of friends they are good example of how well religion can affect society if we educated people and had them either further educate or cut ties with people who have immoral concepts things would improve as well not shitting on your opinion just giving my two cents ll just give my paise religion is meme no not in an advice animal kind of way but if you go by the original meaning of meme it is an idea that compels people to propagate it in this meme behaves like an organism such as virus thus religion is meme another point to support this is that religion does not exist without people religion needs people to survive without people religion cannot exist therefore people are more important than religion because people came first religion wholly exists in the minds of people it is not tangible thing paisa more religion does not only mean belief in some god imo even nationalism and patriotism can be religions in their own right although agree heres clip of joe rogan talking to physicist brian greene www youtube com watch gpstpnabcw on the actual purpose of religion very interesting take and agree with him too but most people take their religions very literally would you like to join the church of shrek in this world good people will do good things and bad people will do bad things but for good man to do bad things it takes religion became an athiest due to few reason but mainly because of eiliot talk on religion which stuck with me for years introspected on it never found contradiction so quit believing in my religion there are lot more reasons but still one of the lines he said was religion is nothing but poorly written sci fi franchise that we are huge fan boys of why are wars fought in his name if peace is what he desires the best one god is drug and we are the addicts ameni read book by jack donovan the way of men in the book he said that it man primal desire to belong to group to be part of something greater than himself the teens and young adults that you see rioting on the streets are fulfilling their desire to belong to something to fight for something to stand shoulder to shoulder with fellow men everything else is superficial excuse to act on that instinct when you have large population of uneducated people devoid of critical thinking abilities they are pretty much zombies acting on instinct and very shallow reasoning which is evident when you hear those arsonists talk these people are the pawns unknowning and unpaid mercenaries of anyone smart enough to rally them the universe is billion years old the earth only billion what was god doing during those billion years also when we finally get to mars and other star systems maybe in the future how will we get to heaven where is heaven can we go faster than the speed of light going from the other star system to go back to earth and go into heaven of hell god is fake and made up evolution is real and we will all die eventually our planet will be unbearable for human life as we know it amen to thispreach op babe can we smash op gf no m waiting til marriage op fuck all religion it bullshit you have successfully summarised the trimmings of your education and preserved this moment in time m excited for you not many people get to develop further and then be able to point back to the moment they were so very wrong appreciate the effort though as used to believe what you have written so it a clear view onto my past self well articulated if may throw you crumb of comfort life would be boring if we had all the answers so in the future when you read these words again you may wonder as do now the vast learning opportunities that remain is this by any chance in context to the current political situation in india because if it is then it would seem like very irresponsible thing to project onto social media like an all lives matter kind of argument g saying the same thing in country where atheists are being prosecuted or where people stigmatized atheists is noble and brave thing but saying the same thing in china would mean siding with thier current regimes inhumane persecution and rounding of of muslims in concentration camps not to mention feeding into thier weird obsession with tibet and who the next dalai lama should be imagine pakistani saying fuck hinduism and fuck islam while hindu village is burned by mullah led mobs blaming the oppressor doesn have to mean you blame the victim as well and as much as you probably don mean it that way in the current context it seems lot like that ps if you re going to bring in the fact that it not just hindus attacking muslims but the opposite as well d want to invite you to remember it starts in the broader context of the caa nrc under which it fairly obvious who going to be suffering atheismso have to ask what happening in india that got this guy so riled up against religion glad that you ve out grown religion this post is gold totally agree with youall religions are fantasy like harry potter but let be honest not all religions are the same some are worse than others when it comes to coexisting some christians and muslims believe every word in their fantasy book and are influenced by it to hate those who aren like them or are homosexuals have you ever tried to read and interpret what written in any religious text like the gita amen brotheryes complete agreement call this anti theism not atheism religion is tool people use to deal with living it isn just about death unfortunately we re not pure logical being lot of people with emotions will turn to higher powers in any form sadly this message will never reach to the people who need to see this among them most will simply reject it religion is the husk of faith tao te chinglets all realize that the universe doesn care because it cannot take action based on our species and this shared planet to protect ourselves by cherishing all life around us resist the animal nature or mammalian ways do not overpopulate the planet assuming only humans are important do not pollute and exploit based solely on your very short life span but instead think of long term life we are evolution and each choice brings about rewards or failures for our species lets choose to share with all life and allow room because from what we can observe there is no global universe consciousness that cares the amount of scientific evidence for religion and flat earth theory is exactly the same as society we just accept the former because it been around for so long and is tradition you forgot years ago we became best freinds with wolves and they have had our backs since they have shed more blood for us than you could imagine fighting off animals to protect our children and crops and domestic animals hate how people thank god when it was dog by our side fighting and dying with us damn you went rough before religion there were tribes and races people always loved to form groups for recognition and unity thats just the nature of us humans removing religion will not stop violence although admitting it is very easy weapon something else will take its place what needs to be removed is hate and instate understanding our differences and accepting each other religion is to humans is what modi is to india agree loltoo bad modi doesnt feel the same way tbh religion fills in the gaps that makes other feel unimportant as they do not matter to the universe you can follow religion and my opinion of you wouldn go any lower and rather than having emotions that make you feel unimportant it can be good at times tl dr religion is outdated but it fills an important role why are we here what next why did this bad thing happen to me look at all these people they compete for my education my job my housing my future wife they are my enemies why should not harm others there are bunch of questions that are very hard to answer without some fundamental truth or lacking that something that you accept as fundamentally true kendrick lamar once said fuck your ethnicity thanks also today is ash wednesdaythey like to say that religion brought people together no it united certain groups of people to become stronger than other groups of people so that they might kill and decimate them fuck all religion yes otherwise religion will fuck us all can have an amen someone get this guy some jesus in his life asap well that certainly one opinionlook into the church of the flying spaghetti monster this is the only understandable religion imo it ain that bad guess it because religion has never been negative thing in my life and ve been lucky to be born into country that allows me to practice what want in community that is forgiving and for family that doesn judge literally do not care what my neighbors believe or don believe agreethank you you are better than every god bothering nobodyi am glad they burnt petrol pump at least someone is unhappy because of hiked fuel prices dplease talk about economy at this stage man please people were saying the growth rate has been negative but since the has started have heard or read no news on how the economy is going agree well saidreligion is politics something you use to keep society under control but wouldn use the word here some people are good enough to do things on their own but plenty others need guidance and once again rookie mistake of connecting deity with religion the one who follows religion is the one who follows the rules of society but the one who seeks god is the one who renounces all possesion and abandons the social life like this oneit is superstition like ghosts or bigfooti really really wish ravi zacharias could respond to some these comments it would be hilarious and sad at the same time didn know had twin in india wishing you great life friend too right completely agree especially with all the shit going on in delhi rnyup finally someone said it finally someone who gets it and is talkong sense religions are one of the biggest cancers of the world right now and if you really believe the bullshit they tell dont know what to tell you life isnt fairytalenow this is good post religion is like spoiled milk hey fuck you buddy modi ganggg hoes madtime to sort by controversiallife was party till religion came along humans still understood right from wrong because they have emotions understanding right from wrong is all that matters if only people have the will and the mind to believe what they actually believed all these years is utter bullshit can only imagine better world without religion more morale more discipline and whole lot of love thank you op you are correct very well written and wish you the best there are some wonderful bollywood anti religious

person for this op respect your opinioni see that title upvote isn it ironic that almost all atheist have god complex finnaly something can read lmaohere from all and just wanted to say hell yes india your country seems amazing in many ways but also so damn backwards til that atheist or none is not even an option for official religions beliefs in your country when you look at the trends for how humanity is progressing almost every advance is met by decline in religion get that shit outta there and this from spiritual person buddhist atheist functionally agnostic and canadian for context if it matters may you all be well and happy may you all be at peace congratulations you ve just explained the core of buddhism m only partly joking buddhism main tenents are non theistic and are about abandoning attachment in order to live fully in the moment and see the world clearly but get your point man wish more people could read this the whole country needs to read this wise man once said religion is the opium of the masses any guess who but in india that ideology is also made villain by constant propaganda if anyone can kick sanghi asses its them the early people realizes the best what makes me angry the most is that it is killing the scientific temper in our ppl preach heh seriously though yes fuck em all take it back flying spaghetti monster is realof course everyone is confused the universe is infinitely complicated we shouldn look down on them for their ignorance don think all religions are bad but don think any of them are correct do believe there is something after we die you can create or destroy anything in this reality it only changes form this fuck yeah man you nailed it fuck religion ,Politics
german exchange student at iit madras is being sent back home by the indian immigration department because he joined the protest www reddit com india comments eevg german exchange student at iit madras is being if foreigners are not allowed to engage in indian politics then look forward to canadian kumar imminent deportation order of course he would talk positively of our country political climate to his fellow citizens back in germany deleted so nrc for germans as well this will cause only streisand effect here is the link indianexpress com article india citizenship law protests india german student iit madras lite twitter impression trueauf wiedersehen mein freund dankewhat harm german guy could possibly have done by joining protests by sending him back this current indian govt gave an impression against the gandhi thing they sell so cleverly overseas even though this can quite expose our current govts true intentions it unfortunate that in front of the international community it is india the whole country which will see tainted image wait then please do something about apolitical canada kumar tooman admire the germans years ago had the audacity to say dont care about politics went to germany for phd and postdoc and the amazing colleagues primarily german taught me to be socially environmentally and politically responsible and not by preaching but leading by example and the best thing is they don even give it thought because for them this is business as usual should not generalize because my sample size was small and skewed but understand why it is still sane voice when all other countries are dealing with their trumps they made me better person we all indians are idiots to think that we have true freedom of speech expression solidarity is the most virtuous form of tourism this man is hero acche din sthere is certain individual named tarek fatah who is pakistani expelled canadian citizen currently resident in india this jerk involves in all kinds of political activities at the behest of bjp why he is not expelled yet share this make this more popularbhakts and sanghis are the biggest group of insecure losers and anti nationals our country has ever seenhe was my friend for everyone taking for granted laws prohibiting participating in protest as foreigner it used to be illegal to sell salt without paying tax to the british east india company there is difference between what is legal and what is right this man did what is right on the bright side german liberals will now know about desi nazis iit student here allegedly the german consulate was ready to provide legal advise to the student but he insisted he return to his country because he did not feel safe this was tweeted out by one of our alumnis and if anyone is wondering yes the whole administration of iit is under bjp support lot of confusing details arising some saying student visas prohibit you from participating in anti government protests but that certainly wasn the case for me in the us so is it specific to countries it certainly does make sense though wahh modi ji wahhnever got the oci card and don intend to until this xenophobic misogynistic and anti national party is in power they have started with the muslims will move to the christians then sikhs and then the other smaller groups gradually till they have wiped out the population and are left with the bhakti population there is civil war brewing hmm so german non muslim became first person to be deported instead of muslim so the government is against dissent not any religion for them the particular community is just scapegoat of authoritarian rule any government that issues curfew is fascist government that ripe for revolution imagine being so insecure you deport this guy for that posterhow ironichas more balls than some of our fellow indians any government that cuts off the internet is fascist government that ripe for revolution good for him that he left he wouldn have to deal with the nonsense and stupidity of this govt anymore isn there huge american nri diaspora that supports the terrible twins modi and shah if german national danke schonjakob is not allowed to talk about india how are these foreigners allowed to do so tarek fatty maria wirth francois gutter david filth canadakumar taslimanasreen just bcuz all the above toe the sanghi line this is iit madras wish dmk or some party do some dharna before the institute poor guy its very sad that we treat him this way nazi germany coming soon any government that equates peaceful protest or assembly to crime is fascist government that ripe for revolution ah yes student was identified and singled out for deportation lets continue to spread his face around did he nazi that coming its really unacceptable germany too has so many indian exchange students who can be sent back to india in response of this but indian government won think of it and is taking these foolish steps it is going to ruin country reputation they dont even realize that by suppressing any voice of dissent they are just proving that voice rightshame on politicians for doing this like treating these students bunch of hooligansman how insecure have we become aren you supposed to refrain from political activism when you are from another country think they have you write sign that during visa or immigration process india where its not okay to protest but its okay to poop in the streetsindia is getting in famous under modi era moronic bhakt removed while people keep comparing the current government to nazis people don realize the british tory government was responsible for the death of times more indians in india narrative is written by the victor may be the problem is also that germany lost the war and they couldn hide their crimes like the brits or americansthis will certainly ruffle some feathers with the german government germany is one of the last bastions where protest and freedom of speech are held sacrosanct neo nazis and skinheads routinely assemble in berlin and protest and the police provide them protection because everytime great counter protest gets organized by anti nazis or the sane people this is stupid act by this vengeful government under the ghar wapasi yojana of shri yogi ji government technically in several countries there are similar rules for foreigners from protesting against the government it not new thing so there is nothing to be surprised here to be fair the authorities are following orders foreigners in india are not supposed take part in political protests im lost outta the loop how can the indian immigration department send german man back to germany removed eeeeeerrriiiiikaaaaaaagosh this is shockingly direct ofc you re allowed to protest against the government of the country you re studying in as an immigrant not like there are any terms he signed while doing procedure for visa like try protesting against the german government when you re there for studies and lmk if that turns out well thought yall were bit considerate but guess most of you are just brainwashed removed ha ha am sure feku and taklu will not like that thought they rather burn the country than lose power he violated the terms of his visa it makes sense he was deported this dudes like don think he was theregermans would know best the consequences of inaction removed not good idea to do so under temp visa in any country but that man has guts or probably he regretted living in india during the time as he should be regardless of his position on politics these aren his politics and he should stay out of protests imagine voluntarily going to india comparing hitlers nazi germany to the current indian situation or anything is the thing only idiots would do and he deserves to be sent back is there any reliable source for this news any document that the op has access to share it interesting how people jump to conclusions without verifying the authenticity of the news am scared now will germany retaliate and not allow me to study in germany through daad forget about the educational qualification is there single person in this party having atleast comon sense whole india is going to face the consequences awesome he can now push for the ones left out of caa to be included as german citizens he broke his visa law what you guys expect it mentioned in the constitution and visa forms good what kind of dumb ass goes to foreign country and starts shit if he were to do that in hong kong he might end up in situation far worse than just being deported he should count this as learning lesson and move on removed this is not something can agree with mean come on comparing to that period know what we are fighting for and it very bad and all but that comparison is way too much remember reading somewhere an individual in visa cannot take part in political demonstrations not an indian visa it just surprising that indian immigration were so quick to pick up and act on this finally some good freaking newsthose who are getting sad on this news request you all to go to germany and protest peacefully against german right wing party alternative for germany let me know what happens what the source of information yeh tatkal deportation koi naya service chalu hua hai kua removed although this isn as serious as those timeswhy the hell would anyone want to become an exchange student in india go see france italy or sweden or use the networking opportunities in the us the uk japan or china why india foreign national breaks visa rules foreign national is deported more at honestly this is better outcome than expected when started reading the post title why not change your name from india to anti bjp cause all you do is post left wing propaganda don attack me in comment section m neutral guy using my freedom of speech to tell the truth removed deleted to be honest although agree with everything on this sub reddit and the fact that modi gov is full of shit and caa and nrc is unconstitutional still believe this is right thing cos in protest related to politics of country should not be influenced by an outsider have seen his post here before was anything but happy but think about this if the situation was different where foreigner was supporting another side or wrong side it would influence alot of people not be healthly thing also m obviously over exaggerating things but the last time foreigners interfered with our politcs was when the british raj happened although m very thankful and love him for his support and also reminding us about the history and essence of what started nazism deporting him was still right thing and m sure he knew about it too which just makes him that much more of hero nicehe knew what was coming for him you will be deported in other countries alsothats what you get to literally say kisi aur ke fate mai apni tang dal ke ,Politics
dear hindus we indian muslims rejected an islamic state in now it your turn to reject hindu nazi state speak up now www reddit com india comments eaxdzc dear hindus we indian muslims rejected an islamic have successfully managed to make my mom understand how wrong and disastrous this is but the whatsapp and facebook fake agenda is way too strong almost half people won even try to discuss let alone change their view but atleast today saw serious hatred for this bill among common populace in news so have hope lot of comments here saying indian muslim didn choose india but they stuck here as they didn have means to migrate all rich muslims went to pakistan please read wikipedia page of azim premji his father was one of the richest at that time and he was personally invited by jinnah his father rejected azim premji is now the biggest philanthropist of india we can do everything to prove our love for this country but huge part of population will never accept us as true indians who just love their country will try my best to educate all the people around me about the truth things happening right now in my india is deeply worrisome it is people indifference towards this issue that truly scares me as hindus we must speak out on social media to our parents peers and anyone willing to listen that we abhor this religious test of citizenship it is the equivalent of muslims stepping up to denounce islamic terrorism if we don do this it will be assumed that hindus are fascists please talk to everyone about your stance on cab nrc and the bjp rss vhp dear fellow countrymen we are first citizens of india only after that we are any thing like hindu muslim christians sikhs parsi buddhist or any others also all this following of ours is inside our houses when we are outside of houses we are citizens of our nation which have diverse cultural beauty no power of the world can divide us by bringing any types of discriminatory bills or acts like cab there are forces who are trying to bring divide among us but we the indian will unitedly oppose it with full might disappointingly our government have brought this bill but sooner or later it will realize that it not in the interest of the people and will be rolled back if not so people will roll back it sure as an individual what can do am not muslim and agree we should uphold our constitutional values no matter the cost it the very soul of our country we can afford to loose it to those rss douchebagswhat think is most hindus dont have any problem with muslims its more like the politicians are spreading this hindutva agenda not just bjp but all the parties use religion as means of getting votes its the media and the politicians that create division among people right wing trolls defending bjp and their stupid bill there are tamil minorities in sri lanka rohangya in myanmar and uyghur muslims in china why is there no provision for them police thrash students and vandalise the library but its the students who are wrong bjp rss have burned the north east and kashmir fuck them fuck their supporters this is not the hinduism know and this asshole party does not represent hindus but radicle hindutva screenshot of another thread it should be dear bjp it time for nation wide protest and this time demands must be different new political and democratic system we need to redesign our own constitution everyone pays road tax but when was the last time you rode on pothole less road there is no correct manner that country should be governed mp and mla must first take look at their own constituency we vote for the betterment of that but is there any way you can actually tell your mp or mla what you need once elected do they even come back before the elections there is no system to accuse those who misuse their power no system who should do what no system how country should work if someone says something controversial in the parliament they just remove it from the discussion dude this is not your personal diary they should be held accountable for what they said this system is so shit that defense forces are attacking whom they should be defending and trust me they don want to but their salary comes from the government where is the list of people who hid black money they promised to work on that but we all are ghajinis is there democracy here no this is semi dictatorship people think they have the power but guess what we all have been distracted name part that is actually not corrupt in this system we need change in us and this system new people and new system religion can be criteria for citizenship sadas disinterested yank m with you on this but this is bad play appealing to people imagined self interest is much more convincing than appealing to people goodness or reciprocity on past deeds it is the th law of power www youtube com watch zgmbjrpi ms deleted an enlightened society is important people who take their religion seriously are idiots idiots who try to mix their religion with politics are dangerous agree with you but you didn say islamic nazi state so why did you say hindu nazi state once read people on the side of the people always ended up disappointed in any case they found that the people tended not to be grateful or appreciative or forward thinking or obedient the people tended to be small minded and conservative and not very clever and were even distrustful of cleverness and so the children of the revolution were faced with the age old problem it wasn that you had the wrong kind of government which was obvious but that you had the wrong kind of people can be truer right nowan educated and secular hindu like me can never support fascist government who oppresses it own people in the name of religion they trying to make it hindu muslim issue don fall in the trap this is secular vs sanghi issue in real let be together in this fight against those who are snatching our freedom these sanghis are today nazis shun them away they ve completely ruined the sanctity of hinduism ve been travelling to india every year for few years now and year ago had terrifying conversation with an assamese guy who felt all kinds of violence was justified against muslims he seemed well off financially he was educated actually quite friendly with me but it was just awful to encounter someone with that kind of perspective it made me worry that india is sliding towards an ethnic cleansing and with the news lately it seems my fears are justified it nice to see this thread and everybody expressing their distaste for modi fascism it gives me courage don give up lol religion continues to poison the world in the name of an imaginary being that causes way more misery than miracles keep on believing m sorry but how is cab related to india muslims please educate mepakistan executes people who convert to christianity of pakistanis support executing them the constitution of pakistan part ix article says all existing laws shall be brought in conformity with the injunctions of islam as laid down in the quran and sunnah in this part referred to as the injunctions of islam and no law shall be enacted which is repugnant to such injunctions india is offering asylum to persecuted people what is the problem muslims dont need asylum to india when they have countries of their own not sure why hindus are being addressed as whole when half the india doesn have bjp ruling states and only bunch of states ever had bjp govt indian muslims didn have means to migrate lol let me tell you something of my family during the independence fight branch of my family tree lived in the land that is currently known as pakistan it was still india at that time lot of my elderly would travel back and forth hyderabad india in order to meet their relatives when the partition was announced my grand grandfather who lived in hyderabad india was asked by kids are we leaving india he said and quite hindustan apna watan hai not enough money my ass fuck that some even went to pakistan side before partition just to convince and bring the remaining people back to india secular state is the only viable option for an advanced developed and prosperous state you think having religious cohesiveness will make you peaceful my country is like catholic and we ve been at war with each other for most of our years of independence colombia india is great country with great people don let the fucking politicians divide you because of who you think your god is that a personal choice and only you should get say on it not everyone else can someone please link the recent thread which explained how to deal with internet blackout and suggested some apps that work via bluetooth please we stand with you against modi and this atrocious bill dear muslims it the government which is shamelessly attempting to turn our secular india into hindu nation we hindus stand united against this unconstitutional bill passed in the parliament caa should be abolished it is the death of our constitution shame on modi sarkar saynotocaai totally agree with the message but why do people use nazi word so lightly like seriously nazi oh really then why they voted for muslim league in elections in all muslim dominated provinces my father told me all the horror stories when we had to migrate from kashmir we left our house in the middle of the night and two days later they blasted the house stand with cab and nrc because it is my tucking country and all these leeches should be removed from this country um so you low key calling pakistan an islamic nazi state are you kidding me your country is literally called islamic republic of pakistan lmao come back when christians aren lynched for not praying five times daily or eating during ramadan deleted looks like lot of sleeper accounts from the other sub have been activated today why is it that our country is so open to all religions castes and creeds but those muslim countries think times before letting us build hindu temple uae only xb can anyone explain that why can they take all the muslims the governments of the world are struggling really hard at keeping its people fighting each other instead of looking at the corruption there we should be teaming up and fighting these rich powerful planet destroyers god damn it unify the continent and forget religion it breaks my heart to see this kind of shitas someone who lives in iran an islamic state have to say m glad indians are taking different path all we see is gang of people with no knowledge of politics who become politicians and choose their sons as their replacement islamic republic is meaningless term that is given to our dictatorship am so glad am seeing posts like this am terrified for my people in india live outside india what can do i t seems to me democracy everywhere on earth is under attack by the rightists conservative religious old fascists and it is becoming of hegemony of the majority sometimes due to misreprentation or election flaws i t is happening everywhere slowly or fast i s all lost or is there hope after the death of some of the boomers old folks religions are fine and stuff extremist are the scum garbage that ruins everything and even going against their own beliefs they did surgery on grapei not indian or muslim or hindu and know nothing of this issue in fact this is the first m hearing but great for you as we ve seen the power of populism in politics lot in recent years and can imagine how devastating it could be of used effectively in country with population of almost b and literacy rate poda punda in my opinion the entire amendment should be taken down and the citizenship should be given with case by case with the prosecutions they faced being the only differentiator irrespective of religion have bad feeling that this bill was groundwork for introducing nrc all over the country which would potentially make citizenship of millions belonging to religions not mentioned in bill to be rewoked also what if atheist was prosecuted this amendment is just against the idea india was built upon if we judge people by religion if we don protect our commitment to communities then what is difference between people who wanted their own country and country that wanted all kinds of people living in harmony this is the reason the governtment is not providing education to all the people they don want the people to see the difference between right and wrong they don want orthodox indians to have humanitarian feelings they want to hide the history to repeat it but still it was us who gave vote to the so called prime minister note we have to bear him the protests all over the country are gathering pace while they indeed started in muslim universities they are now being picked up all over the name that was happiest to see was benaras hindu university turns out all college kids want an excuse to skip exams jokes apart dont worry indian mozzies we the other ppl of india stand by you no way will rss get away with this you don rejected election of muslim dominant seats demeneed for pakistan you cling morons never want hindus to live happy in indiasorry to burst the bubble guys but this statement is categorically wrong that indian muslims rejected pakistan all indian muslim league ran the indian elections of on the platform of creating pakistan and their overwhelming success in these elections later on provided them basis for putting the demand for partition to the british here is the breakdown of the seats won by muslim league for the creation of pakistan in elections for the separate muslim electorate assam won out of seats of total bengal won out of seats of total bihar won out of seats of total bombay won out of seats of total central provinces won out of seats of total madras won out of seats of total north west frontier province won out of seats of total orissa won out of seats punjab won out of seats of total sindh won out of seats of total united provinces won out of seats of total total won out of seats of totalno indian muslim is will be being denied citizenship all citizenship clauses of article are there with no changes new law is just for persecuted minorities who only have single home country and nrc is for neighbouring infiltrators who have majority in their respective states and have no right to stay in india illegally amd should return back rest million muslims in india are safe as ever if nationwide nrc is implemented everyone from hindu to muslim have to prove their citizenship which can be done by using single document like voter id card please refrain from being hyprocrate and be logical evaluating any government decision dont try to form your views on what others tell you be yourslefplease remove this misunderstanding that indian muslims in rejected islamic state instead they helped create onei ashamed by this move by the govt and m bjp supporter for some policies at least really hope supreme court strikes down cabsounds good but what about pakistan and bangladesh born hindu agree what modi is doing is deep shame on our country and goes totally against both the fabric of our society as well as even the basic tenets of hinduism for the first time ever am truly ashamed to be an indian hindu majority of hindus will slap all rss chaddis the endgame ha started for them removed if indian muslims rejected an islamic state in don know who supported jinnah for creation of pakistan call me bhakt but comparing indias current policy with facism and modi with hitler and rss with isis is just too much the only reason cab is happening without muslims is because those countries afgan pak bangla are openly persecuting minorities as they are islamic country whats wrong if the minorities want to come here as refugees the other ones muslim refugees are not persecuted based on their religion apart from shias ahemadias etc ps don support hindutva but firmly believe that even if india becomes hindu state it will offer wayy wayy more freedom than those islamic state mean no one will force to wear tikka here like they force woman incl non muslims to wear burkah an all though india should always be secular but the blame game is one one side only they are expert at playing victim cards agree or not and believe me if owasi continues to tear bills and incite communal hate in his speeches bjp will keep getting votes it will win in next elections aswell even if modi is not there dear hindus we indian muslims rejected an islamic state in hello pakistan broke away from india in because muslims in the then indian province wanted their own islamic state the slogan raised in jamia rally were hum leke rahenge azadi hinduon se azadi enough said was fairly left wing but this is just the last straw removed first off you didn choose your ancestors did secondly that doesn say for all muslims am not anti or for just playing devil advocate to prove its weak argument now can some one explain what is the problem with cab have just been over it once and do not see anti muslim all it says is it will accept non muslim refugee from countries isn that good thing am just looking at the glass half full probably they should have included other muslim sects that are oppressed wtf is this hindu nazi state bc look at them middle eastern countries it not even percent of what happening there know this government suck ass big time and chodi is mofo pm idk what to do guess we re all just in time chamber waiting to explode if this report is right please verify youtu be oivpibvmti then the events unfolding right now are all direct consequence of mishandling the partition and or initiating it in the first place the british post ww government the muslim league the rss the inc all have directly contributed to this via their actions around plus in present day we create our own demons as an hindu apologise to all muslims for how stupid our country is especially the govti don understand why indian muslims are protesting when the bill doesn even concern them are they fighting for the illegal muslim immigrants and does the fight for illegal muslim immigrants warrant torching trains and buses blocking ambulances and shouting hinduon se azadi don believe one bit now in the rioters and in bangalore they held up boards about babri is this about babri cab or just violence to show that you can wield such power from the masses cab protests have taken an ugly turn filled with hatred and the rioters seem to be making case for cab understand the north east doesn want any illegal immigrants be it hindu or muslimif you are indian muslim reading this then am sorry if you feel unsafe here we did this to you by electing known murderer it not shock to see what happening its shocking to know so many people want this to happen bjp getting voted into majority twice is sign in itself that education has lost its meaning in india bigots were waiting for the right time to show their true colours they are doing it now speak up as much as you can for the right thing as sane voices are in limited supply right now people high up in the society government are not to be trusted anymore country has been successfully divided and increasingly being pushed towards an unfortunate future fock bjp it rules and it policiesi wasn paying attention to cab because of personal shit it hit me when my muslim friend told me he is worried because of cab fuck you modi you won let us live in peace downgrading india again and again m hindu and everyone in my family is bjp supporter except me couldn vote this year and now m regretting it grew up my entire life in old delhi area with lots of muslims around many friends many almost family to my hindu family never ever had issues differences problems on either side only after grew up did realize that hindu muslims have to not connect sir gladly and proudly reject any nation that does not let people across faiths in peace and with love do not approve of cab or any such policy law also reject all this violence whoever may be doing it if you rejected islamic state when how did pakistan form muslims voted to have separate state im gonna sound pessimistic can handle myself can help others m all in all can help now you guys should have kept the status quo instead of passing this law and let your embassy official make the decision case by case if hindu muslim sikh etc need asylum in hindustan respek to hindu nationalism from the west sorry to say didn choose islamic state think there are two countries adjacent to india which are solely built on basis of religion which is infact islam anytime hear nazi or fascist your argument immediately loses credibility both those words have been watered down to the point of being meaningless we need to come up with new words for people we disagree with you did not do shit the british had divided these two race we should have reversed it long time ago here is good video that explains the border youtu be rpstzxanwhy are his glasses specifically in hd removed cab is just solving one specific problem or evil it doesn need to address all the problems e muslim migrants from pakistan afghanistan or bangladesh or for that matter immigrants from any country like africa mexi not protest for them as far as violation of constitution goes constitution applies to only the citizens of india and these the immigrants or refugees people are not yet citizens be it muslims or any minorities from pakistan afghanistan or bangladesh nrc if it is trying to disenfranchise muslims of india then it against the constitution and everyone should and will oppose it eliour country is on brink of something big it either can be good or can be very bad it your turn to decide interesting not the best track record m not well versed in indian politics or history but wasn the two states plan meant to create hindu and muslim states removed how does cab concerns indian origin muslims india is not land it a people guys what makes you think this amendment is against legal muslims do not see any adverse impact on indian muslims interesting that you refer to pakistan as an islamic state but then refer to modi hindu prioritisation in india as hindu nazi state why just not say that we should reject hindu state why add nazi to it lol would you be ok with india being non nazi hindu state right now indian had two options either to be religious extremist country like saudi arabia or to be diverse peaceful and developed country like uae and let me tell you saudi is looked down by many people in the world while uae is seen as developed and rich country the decision is in our hands you changed the currency muslim hindu everyone stood in the line you said care for the rights of muslim women and penalised triple talaq we stood with ur decision and we were happy with ur care you made kashmir state of india we rejoiced with joy and felt proud now you bring cab and wanna give everybody the citizenship except us seriously if still think we won stand then are wrong we will stand but this time against mein mussalman zaruur hun but hindustani hun when changed the currency should have said only muslims will have new currency when said kashmir is state of india should have said only non muslims should rejoice if didn say it then why are muslims denied of the citizenship now india has five letters so does islam if deprive us of our right to be called as indian then piss on ur acche din man hindus stand up what india is turning into is not what our brave freedom fighters died for this india is what godse would want and he didn do shit to free you rise brothers rise we owe it to the people who fought for our independence we owe to the millions of faceless and nameless people who dreamt of united india we need to keep their dream alivei really don know whom to trust mean there have been so many examples of how indian muslims claimed they are brothers of rohingya muslims and muslims around the world first and then only indians after that could we trust the muslims now and those who use muslims as vote banks the memory of how muslim vote vetoed atal bihari vajpayee nd term is still fresh in the memory if indian muslims are really indians first then would ask them to prove that they are by resolving their enmities within muslim sects shia vs sunni for in india first show us that the conflicts dictated among muslim sects internationally is something you surrender to make amends with muslim sects between indian muslims that would be good show that iranian and saudi religious politics doesn influence our indian muslims that would your own indian muslim identityone thing is for sure good or bad this cab won be taken back may be because you must be knowing the human psychology equal and opposite reaction how india is hindu nazi state anyone care to explain please we re all human ms each of us makes mistake don mean to be condescending understand this is scary show the rest of the world how the people can work together for what they wantliberal hindu here can anyone please explain me how this bill effects the muslim citizens of india am not asking this question as statement to support caa am genuinely curious as the centre clearly propose it as provision to protect the minority in the nation also am in principle against caa because of two factors one it wrong to propose this nationwide without having the knowledge of proper numbers and stats without proper data things may end up like demonetisation secondly am against it coz think it bad for the north east state like assam or bengal can anyone put good points for and against the caa so that we can have well informed opnion m confused is this all about an immigration policy about refugees from other countries how did this impact folks from india muslim or otherwise rejected muslim state in pakistan exists youtu be gdlexju muslims who didnt leave india during partition voted for pakistan elections which decided the formation of pakistan muslim league won of muslim votes it won all the reserved muslim seats in bombay and madras provinces all muslims seats in up central india hyderabad bengal kerala the only place where muslim league did not win majority of muslim seats was in nwfp pakistan this is the proof muslims of india created pakistan voted for muslim league jinnah pakistan in muslims went to pakistan only stayed in india after partition mostly in kashmir bengal assam kerala up just for occupying looted properties from hindus occupying mosques built over hindu temples most impt to finish unfinished agenda of islam e gazwa hin pls see the general election of of akhand bharat will be amazed that at that election indian muslims voted for muslim league jinha for making pakistan here is sardar patel speech conforming the same www youtube com watch hfn muslims pakistani or arabistani or bangladeshi not indian its dar ul harab for them preparing for gazwa hind pakistan zindabad is going in india everywhere where muslims in ghetto mini pakistan www youtube com watch time co pure islam is pure terrorism politically weak muslims tends to be peaceful ones but once they get any kind of political power muslims show their true nature thats the jihadi in them who wage war in order to surrender the non muslims to islam make them dimmeys kill who dontthere is flaw in the caption hinduism means tolerant and multifarious worship is the norm attaching nazi with hindu and leaving muslim as it is is cruel any thoughtsno we won because we re hypocrites don think that it a joke the word nazi is being doled out so frequently and casually these days that you ve managed to dilute its seriousness entirely congratulations removed removed m sorry m don have much opinion about the cab but know that the law proposes the admission of minorities from three neighbouring countries how is it against the muslim population of india and emphasise on the indian part here lol what if muslims rejected the idea of two nation theory then how did jinnah got india divided majority of muslims voted in favour of it wtf of course indian muslims didn get an islamic state because india has big majority of hindus if the muslims tried to establish an islamic state india would ve crushed them so what m trying to say is that muslims didn reject an islamic state because they re so nice but because they didn have any choicenarendra modi has been exactly what india represents the people with absolute zero tolerance of other religion culture or cast sometimes laugh so hard when people say india is country of diversity and people embrace it it is full of horse shit nepal neighbouring country of india can teach many things about developing tolerace and in society it is much smaller country than india but d argue even more diverse until and unless indian society learns to develop tolerance towards each other dont think there is any hope for the country and if tolerance is so far fetched the country should be divided into many small nations india never was single entity its been an extremely forceful unification so far and indians attitude towards their own dark skinned members lower caste uber hate for muslims and vice versa north south division hate and down pointing languages in every conversations small to big towards people of low class and occupation like auto driver security guard and others reek of very unhealthy society that shouldn live together not to mention there is almost zero respect for anything outside familiar zone from indians be it respect for others on road mall que differently looking and speaking people or foreigners and poverty and lack of education is such bullshit excuse for it there are many nations poorer and less educated than indians but have much more functioning civilized society and have much more potential in them such as nepal think india as whole is failed nation and society it would be much better if they divide and form small nations that will find their way to development in homogeneous way without having to develop tolerance which evidently indians fundamentally and painfully lack ,Politics
spend nearly rs bucks to watch joker and in return all got was mins of advertiment before the movies mins adver in interval giant subtitles and stupid tobac which stuck through of the time in the screen which made crucials scenes so distracting and out of focus www reddit com india comments ddziqc spend nearly rs bucks to watch joker and in m just glad the movie was uncut such violent scenes actually surprised me and it added to the factor of not completely sympathising with joker the tobac wasn distracting to me most of us are used to that shit but the interval kind of ruined the flow of the movie think had watched spiderman without intervals wish it there was none for this movie too still great movie loved it first time same and to make it worse got hindi subtitles instead of english mins of advertisement before the film and minutes during interval did you actually go to theater in india for the very first time its either bucks or rs you typed both its like saying rip in peacethankfully the theatre watched it in didn switch on the sub titles as for the smoking and drinking disclaimer love the hypocrisy of our governments they won stop selling they won stop promoting tobac they won stop taking the money from the big tobacco but still they would ban products that a challenge to big tobacco and still put out such ads and if somebody doesn put these out they are fined xb slow clap here subtitles were in hindi man when he said yes in scene subtitle were haan ji bilkul and was like no bilkul toh katai nahi bola isnecan that warning be displayed only once before the movie starts why would they ruin the immersion by plastering it throughout the movie censor board is literally bunch of irredeemable morons intermission did disturb the flow of this movie it took good ten minutes to get back into the flowever sat beside someone who thinks she he knows every fucking thing and tries to be smart ass and can shut her his mouth the whole movie and in the end goes like that it s group of girls ruined our annabelle comes home you haven mastered the art of enjoying films in indian theatres my friend at least there weren any excited fanbois screaming and jumping up and down were you the asshole who was taking pictures during the movie sounds like you just went to theatre for the first time went to pvr to watch it had fucking hindi subtitles and live in punjab it was so distracting and the fucking audio quality was like watching pirated handycam print movie gonna watch it againirony whole bunch of us were stopped at the entrance because the national anthem was being played inside later saw that family brought year old to watch an rated movie incredible india why is this flaired demonetization tobac lac people each year like who cares that why don go to theatre tickets are expensive no outside food drinks allowed you have to be earning fortune to afford that shitty theatre food one phone is always ringing and baby is always crying somewhere couples making out in corners hour long ads these are just few things me and almost every movie goer hates good thing is we have torrent have to wait bit for good quality print but it worth wow always knew india had the world largest number of cinema goers but didn realise you also had the world worst cinema experience ikr fuck pvrmostly shit movies bollywood and regional subpar viewing experience thanks to all the ads and assholes shouting howling all the time overpriced snacks this is why stopped going to cinemas long time ago for tenth of the price can get better food and nicer viewing experience at home most movies come to streaming services quickly now there no reason to go to cinemas except for some true big screen experiences deleted remember woody allen refusing to release his films in india because the indian censor board asked to put the disclaimer regarding cigarettes and alcohol woody saw this as an affront to his artistic freedom and liberty and refused to get his films distributed in india sometimes principles are worth fighting for atleast the movie didn have any cuts hey m from delhi anybody here watched joker without the annoying disclaimer and subtitles lmk the theatre vijju from codechef lol happened to me when watched john wick this year it seems that it more likely to happen in rated movies m skipping this one for the same reason will buy blu ray instead or you can always pirate dae hate d the glasses don fit have bad tinting and make scenes darker than they already are and the d effect is barely noticeable and doesn even add to positive experience hope this dumb tech dies soon it a classic example of corporate cash grab not to mention d theatres with english movies are very raredon even remember the last movie ever saw in theater refuse to do the national anthem bullshit forced patriotism jo bhi bolo bc movie world class thi movies at home is way better recaps no annoying people dnt know why they even show the smoking warning like someone actually cares quality food whatever you want bs theatres charge like for boring coffee for veg puffs seriously shit sells for at shops keep your ass stuck to seat for the entire movie bs the only plus for me at theatre dolby atmos only for selected hollywood movies aah hate this guess it mostly happens in big cinemas like pvr we pay huge amount as ticket and all we see is ads we are not watching the movie for free can we do something about it at least you got the english one and presume the aspect ratio was right all got was hindi subtitles with wrong aspect ratio reading in hindi is great but you just can ignore these funny translation they do what wrong with having subtitles how was the movie thoughalways go mins past the starting time where went there was no smoking warning during the whole movie but the subtitles were therefuck pvrin romania you get maximum mins of trailers m realy suprised to hear you get minutes rs die the mne to tum chutiya ban gye ya ho pehle se heei disagree with the subtitles we indian need subtitles more than anything why is everyone always complaining about everything on india also saw the movie yesterday with that disclaimer and subtitles and actually enjoyed it because was focusing on the movie not finding excuses to complain about everything and bucks for movie are you serious paid bucks in cinepolis same thing happened with me you could just tell the staff to let you know when the advertisement end and you can wait outside times they have no problem in let you knowit sucks know but that how it is don know way to change that to me watching movie is akin to admiring beautiful painting don want to be distracted but understand how the world works so don mind the ads although excess ads do get to me but it when they start putting augmented warnings over the movie it sorta spoils the essence of scene this is why contain myself for three months and wait for blu ray to watch at the comfort of my home it a sacrifice but one that don mind think mins ads before movie is common india theatres sold ad time for interval joker doesn need an interval tbh may and discomfort for you but subtitles certainly help majority of people about the disclaimer it not in the whole movie but only in the scene where there is any form of tobac alcohol yes disclaimer is annoying but subtitles are not know the feeling that why don go to mainstream cinemas anymore m not from india but my advice is to if possible select studio cinemas well india has been large consumer of tobac gutka see kids below years eating that stuff also why would they wanna tell people in the theatre that tobac cancer mean the guy who is paying for movie won know that bucks hahaha dkilling parameter is specific this time lmao usually it says smoking kills plot thik tha but for the acting thoughwhat worse is people talking and answering phones during the show try not to watch good dramas in india but other stuff like action movies comedies bollywood dance etc honestly don mind as long as the censorship isn too heavy handed but if m being honest with you just get k big screen and watch at home they re just now in the states so must be even cheaper in india wow that a real asshole design can understand the large subtitles but what is up with the preachy psa taking up any of the screen that the kinda shit you get out in the min trailer commercial psa intro before the movie then let folk enjoy their freaking flick wtf had great experience at half the cost which city do you live in for the prices to be that high have stopped going to theatres since averagers first movie paid bucks for fdfs ticket experience was let down invested in quality monitor ch speakers and internet connection never looked backi remember watching dunkirk last year it was the most disappointing experience ever had first of all reached the theatre minutes late so let go that show coz it nolan and bought the ticket for the immediate next show and waited patiently till the next one so was in mm theatre nolan often uses different cameras imax and film formats throughout the movie the film projections couldn handle it and finally projected the film in the size of tv on the large screen with huge subtitles on top of it also the movie didn live up to the hype it created imo at least you get to see it censorship is bitch those tobac were so distracting just ban it if they are so harmful people still go to theatres to watch movies you guys are fucking funny dude hugs to indialol in addition inox gave me hindi subtitles those motherfuckers when in the beginning it was written english with end subs glad the dialogues were sill in english paid rs in total for first day first show at am admire the dark knight trilogy by nolan that made me admire this movie more score could have been better but by no means it a slouch movie it an art you need certain background knowledge to appreciate it no worries give it another try if you just went because hype was there then it understandable it dark but fun the tobac was batter but it was only till the starting of the movie m so glad that indian board gave it go without any cuts the movie was good the acting was one of the best out there and it was different than your clickbait movies who no one rememberes after week as matter fact this movie is now on imdbs number on top movie ever ranking have scene almost all of that list and can tell you getting into that list and becoming top is not joke or luck an art takes blood and money and sweat to be accepted by audience salute to the whole team and thank you for the distributors for releasing it in india two days prior first time in my life was excited for movie this will be memory will cherish for my adult life peace out am british but have lived in maharashtra for the last years censorship on tv has gotten so bad that they are now censoring words like penis and ass was watching deadpool on tata sky channel sony pix or something and entire scenes were missing and advert breaks lasted upwards of minutes indian conservatism has gone too far even relatively family friendly shows like friends and the big bang theory are heavily censored now where do you live rs for movie ticket in hyderabad at most its rs rs bucksrandi rona karne ko keh do bas what kind of theatres did you fine peoplaan patronize such experiences est une fatigue impossible slurps the coffee chomps the maggi reclines the lounge chair self talk what are those peoplaan ranting about wonder presses the button for could have peri peri mixed with caramel popcorn delivered on my seat please tucks himself back into the warmth of the complimentary blanket and people sitting behind you had to get distracted by your phone because you wanted picture of distracting your experience was lolsame experience in pvrsounds like regular pvrsamethey couldn put the disclaimer in corner even the subtitles are the worst dude you should be happy they did not cut half the movie at least you didn get beaten up for not standing up during the anthem the worst part is that after the intermission they rewind the movie by mins this completely breaks the flow of the movie imo that sign was so fucking annoying but it india don understand if you don want people to get cancer then why the fuck do you sell it lolf samei was going to watch it alone this week but the prices deterred me don understand why is everybody cinema experience so bad compared to mine what theaters do you go to where there minutes of ads before the movie the most had to sit through was minutes and guess what there was no intermission for joker where went there was warning before that the film was unaltered and shown in full viewing you spent five hundred so sit through all that that amazing the most spent on ticket was and for the joker spent somewhere around mostly go to pvr cinemas and never saw such delay before the film the smoking disclaimer was distracting though fuck that don understand why is everybody cinema experience so bad compared to mine what theaters do you go to where there minutes of ads before the movie the most had to sit through was minutes and guess what there was no intermission for joker where went there was warning before that the film was unaltered and shown in full viewing you spent five hundred so sit through all that that amazing the most spent on ticket was and for the joker spent somewhere around mostly go to pvr cinemas and never saw such delay before the film the smoking disclaimer was distracting though fuck that feel you bro advertisements are so stupid how can one watch for so long also in theaters they clear words or any other curse words from movie but still can understand so no point at doing whatever they are trying do and tobac is real distraction isse achcha ghar main baith ke under red hood dekh letethis time instead of mukhesh there was someone elsethat why do piracy might as well be asking for some flak here but all gonna skip the fact that they gotta play the national anthem before every movie the least we can do our soldiers in siachen the tried and tested approach of do little to rebuild the nation ground up and give it direction but have reminders put up here and there so patriotism isn forgotten fuck ads manthe theater went to didn have any of these problems even the subtile was small yet readable and not distracting and there was no tobac warning ps the theater was big cinemas so stop smokingthank god didn experience the ad thing went to cinepolis saket they started the move mins later than the intended time just one cancer ad and national anthem that it also they had the shortest interval time wasn more than mins they definitely pull this shit in pvr which is why don go to pvr now ee nagaranikemaindilagta hai india mein naye hoi remember watching fury in theatre and the smoking warning would come up any time cigarette showed up on screen and m thinking this movie is literally about humans killing humans the nazis killing the jews and the allied forces killing nazis how about warning about that went to pvr surprisingly they didn put that warning in every scene probably because it already rated in india was thinking that this would have been quite disturbing if they decided to put warning in every scene because he was smoking half the time cinema in delhi is the absolute best in these regards no ads at all there is an interval but no ads are played the only downside of this is that the movie starts playing immediately when the doors open this is stupid and can easily be fixed by opening the doors minutes prior to starting the moviei watched it on imax the experience was great except for the giant subtitles the tobac was far left so no issues disclaimer subtitles in imax is bad idea taba are fucking disgusting to watchthat what love about sathyam spi cinemas movie starts on dot on advertised time the ads are shown before so you arrive time for the good partdude advertisements are shown in every theatre but got hindi subtitles i watch subb animes and got distracted every min but subtitles had the same experience mins of advertisement just killed any thrill of watching the movie further the tobac every mins was just too much to handle finally the movie was mediocre at best so wasted my bucks spend nearly rs spent and witnessed all that humble brag much sabki ticket itne ki hi hai janaab they also beep any word that a bit offensive like son of beeep bucks paid for imax screen so comfortable and large seats that felt like child sitting in adult seat with extra leg space the screen was big and also was curved the picture quality and sound quality was exceptional subtitles were accurately placed minute advertisement maximum the tobac did bother me as well my theatre is the best they always start the movie on time there are not lot of ads only ten minute break and really well mannered staffall of the above but with difference the subtitles were hindi and the bucks were only at our local pvr and the national anthem for me the movie was more important than my hate for ads and couple sitting behind who just won shut the fuck up fucking done with people rs bucks the fucked up minds that banned outside food and started compulsory anthem should ban advertise too or make them publish before hand how much advertise they will show in the movie like statutory warning of smoking welcome to india wait for torrent lolmovie experience sucks in india will wait for blu ray for my inch oled with surround soundwhere did you go hollywood movies in india have these problems so much that prefer to wait and buy dvd also cinema goers are very inconsiderate that they talk whole time watch two movies per day for month at data plan that movies month with no ads no bs if the government is so concerned about the people smoking and destroying their health why not tax it heavily like australia does or just ban it altogether like they did with vapes and cigs noooo we gotta show off being hypocrite yeh sab gyan kyu chodte hai public ka entertainment ke time these asshats also cut obscene violent scenes thankfully didn in this but literally show the horrible tobac disfigured mouth and the beating heart before movie starts every time which looks horrifying agreed but atleast the movie was nutsthat smoking banner looks so ridiculous how is that even allowed you are not supposed to take pics or record in theatre yet you did it so much for releasing the uncut version do you people honestly not reserve your seats and show up to the movie minutes late that way you get there when the movie starts dthey don have subtitles in all the shows you can ask at the ticket counter which one doesn have subtitles and book tickets for that show if booking online on pvr app they have details about which shows have subtitles and if you long press on show timing it will tell you the rates and what time the show ends which find very useful which pvr you went to that opens the doors mins before the movie time to show you the ads and mins interval never experienced any such things pvr or otherwise before this movie hadn been to theatre in years going to theatre to watch this movie has just doubled my resolve you used to think your life was tragedy but now you realize it a comedythere are intervals and disclaimer the whole time wdf go thirty minutes late and during the interval go pee take dump and buy some popcorn problem solved hate tobac fuck that asshole who came up with this shitty idea ahoy there maitey you re lucky got leaky ceiling and unsynced audiowell got hindi subtitles they slew my boy dude had to watch hindi subtitles we live in societymany people literally smoke while watching movies lulyeah this is really annoying thing theatres do in pune as well in pvr you pay extra just for the name and you get extremely loud adverts which are almost always repeated horrendous food which is also expensive they even manage to somehow fuck up the popcorn and long intervals which easily break the flow of the movie all of this after paying the maximum amount they can exploit you for some things are just plain stupid which doesn even benefit them commercially as if they want to fuck with you same frustrating experience with once upon time in hollywood these days big sceeen experience has ruined for me aaand you had to stand up for the national anthem which has no place in an entertainment settingi don mind the beginning trailers as egregious as they are but shoehorned intermissions in movies which clearly don have one not to mention often stuffed with more ads always gets me mad xb also these anti smoking warnings lol don mind single big message in the beginning but like bro showing me the same thing times isn going to change my mind please stop treating me like m stupid lol wait do you mean to tell me the power didn drop out or the screen didn catch fire rs for joker lolso fucking truepvr is absolute junk despite the huge number of theatres they have all over india at least chennai has sathyam cinemas which is miles better and doesn have these issues or costs as much as pvr govt ads before the movie begins are unbearable its pirate life for me savvy dont forget the frickin national anthemand dont forget about the aspect ratio just go minutes late to movies now to skip commercials looks like someone is having their first movie theatre experienceguess it just for pvrs be it dx or imax they re all the same first they ll charge you lot of money then they ll show you lot of pretty boring adslol posted the same and it got removed cause its out of context hahai wonder how many countries play their national anthem before starting every movie like here in india lmao wait all go to movies on fucking time aspect ratio not full screenthe screening which we went to surprisingly didn have the smoking warning but there were shitty hindi subtitles which ruined the experience for us and then they expect us to pay for movies rather than pirating no thanks d rather watch it in hd on my laptop without stupid interruptions and censorship and no don want to stand for national anthem am just here for the movie thanksindia sucks dickha ha wait till you to cinemas in mumbai where they also have waiters bothering you with food smells of the time and kids running around of the time never going to fucking cinemas in pvrso true the flashing tobac were particularly annoying whenever there was hint of on screen smoke it popped up even if it was general city smoke not cigarette smoke yeah same think that movie was alright not not as good as they imaged before releasei hate subtitles and it is one of the reasons why don watch english movies in cinema anymore this is one of the films that felt would be better suited to solo viewing on small screen people laughing along his laughing fits really pissed me off well will leave torrent link when it comes out hope that helps ,NonPolitical

tolerant ruler so much so that once the hindu festival holi and the islamic mourning day of muharram fell on the same day being devout muslim himself he couldn see any reason why hindus shouldn celebrate holi amidst the muharram processions so he asked muharram processions to be taken out the next day so that his hindu subjects could celebrate holi that used to be the religious harmony and tolerance back in those days american here see people shaking hands with each other but don get it m missing some context here salafists hate muharram procession some of my salafi friends keep preaching about how it is haram the change have observed in them past few years is alarming sometimes make me think they hate other muslims the most you can thank the saudi funded preachers for the

culturesbhakts new india wale won like this muharram has nothing to do with these kind of processions no point to highlight these things in media and showcase it as an example for harmony muslims are highly miss represented and thats why people think these fringes as the are practicing islam why there is need of procession if someone is religious pray do pooja go to temple go to mosque and don become headache to general public why there is pathological need to show off religious muscles doesn mean anything they ll still reject any muslim who is trying to find house in their neighborhood india was never secular to begin with deleted when chutiyapa meets deleted virat hindu much anger peaceful no want hindu exists yeah ok ,NonPolitical
weighing us down www reddit com india comments eafmw weighing us down man what would society do without artists and their creative powers one image so succinctly sums up everything that going on this country today deleted wow that is good one think having compressed wheel would be better who is the artist this is brilliant depiction this is just so apt take bow creators sincerely hope that this passes away and we could again live in the india of my childhood there no place for violence and hatred in gandhi country in school was taught that the indian colors stood for bravery peace and prosperity it was only much later in life that got to know that it can be seen from religious perspective as well was disappointed can someone explain this to me know it the indian flag but more meaning and the context removed damn beautiful depiction don think we should allow bunch criminal cowards to appropriate color in the flag these colors mean something totally different bhagwa or the saffron denotes renunciation or disinterestedness our leaders must be indifferent to material gains and dedicate themselves to their work the white in the centre is light the path of truth to guide our conduct the green shows our relation to the soil our relation to the plant life here on which all other life depends the ashoka chakra in the centre of the white is the wheel of the law of dharma truth dharma or virtue ought to be the controlling principle of those who work under this flag again the wheel denotes motion there is death in stagnation there is life in movement india should no more resist change it must move and go forward the wheel represents the dynamism of peaceful change this is the best picture ve come across in days thankssickening that what this iswe really need to spread knowledge about the fact that the saffron colour in our flag stands for courage and detachment not hinduism it a normie concept and thus must be eliminated saffron is the color of hindu not hindutva it a big mistake to cede the color to these fundamentalists because what would regular hindus like me then m not weighing anybody down if you are hindu and do not agree with this fascist regime then flaunt your saffron and show that they are not the thekedars of your religionwow that impressive conveys so much hats off to the designer corruption of congress looks better than the systematic destruction of our social fabric and drowning of economy by bjpas westerner the one thing which holds india together and upright is its hindu heritage otherwise it is no different than the western countries besides its poverty many of you have forgetten the message of vivekananda hinduism is vehicle of love and acceptance any hindu who does not abide by this is not true practitioner of dharma perfect representation of our country today unregulated immigration good so far the most m seeing is nocab supporters and specially muslims are getting more more destructive seeing news of what going on around me is really heartbreaking and not gonna lie for common folk like me is afraid to go out of the house just saw video of mob beating to death cab supporter and m sure you ve seen it too so much for free speech right nocab supporters are posting videos of police beating protesters without any context of why they are getting the beat cab supporters are posting videos of protesters beating random folks breaking ambulances trains burning stuff don know whom to support don want to get beating out of nothing it looks really powerful but don understand the meaning behind it could anyone explain please powerful image today this image speaks the minds and hearts of billion indians so true saffron isn supposed to represent secularism or whatever this is supposed to tackle it a symbol of renunciation source en wikipedia org wiki flag of india think we all should put it as our facebook dpcredits should be given this was made my smishdesigns on instagram what weighing you guys down the pollution you re causing hating religion is okay as long it not minority huh that is the most creative and scarily true thing ve seen all year have no idea what is happening to this nation the problem with this is that its the same thing as saying trump reps are causing all of americas problems except anyone would agree that trump is just symptom of an underlying struggle for power he only riding the wave because the tide already exists since top comments bring it up the cab isn bad in law it differentiates people on an rationale which the courts will probably consider reasonable these people its trying to protect are very real the problem isn a made up one people have been fleeing all these countries for decades now leaving everything behind for the promise of nothing wonder why they do that and this is promise from the manifesto so its definitely not surprise to any of the other parties they re just trying to milk it for its worth and apparently some people are blind reasons why muslims from pak af bl can be excluded without violation article they don form persecuted minority in any of the islamic republics in question except for ahmadiyas in pak who chose to live in pakistan when presented both options during partition and rohingyas who bangladesh has also declared to be security concern so bar these communities the citizens of these countries do not seek refuge and come to india if they do move its for better opportunities challenge you to name one country that has zero grounds on which people are tested before they are given citizenship ever wondered why the most developed countries have low population shouldn every tom dick and harry be moving there after checking the hdi list the argument that everyone should get citizenship and be treated equally literally destroys the point of nation states and borders everyone should obviously be allowed to live anywhere they want on the planet we didn have choice in being born on but that isn how the world works child damn good job making this removed that not saffron represents in indian flag saffron represents courage and sacrifice not religion none of you seem to realise it this is just brilliant deleted so true india was hardly secular ever to begin with except officially but now we have dropped even that pretence this image makes no sense saffron represents as the wiki page says denotes renunciation or disinterestedness am in no way supporting any party but lets not go overboard hmm delusional and shit what make of the picture is that the weight cab nrc and other atrocities of bjp is on the shoulders of that man india you might have different perspective though bjp drowning the nation under that saffron weight this is so dumb one of the best things have seen todayappreciated that is how artists can dip it every thing without uttering single word nobody talks about onion prices now poor onions m not from india but m curious can someone please explain the significance of this art do the lines of the flag represent different people of india or is that orange supposed to be the massive pollution problems hear india has or aww but what yall dont see is the toxic poison below which is wing to come in power silently playing the victim but once it does come in power our future generation will cry tears of blood mark my word liberalsthis speaks thousand words take this gold from this unemployed millennial that all could afford that is quite commentary thx for sharing this would have some meaning in ireland what does this mean think they could be similar can anyone explain what the orange depictswhat is this is it the brown weighs us down amazingly done tan peter griffindisconnect this anti national artists internet indefinitely beejaypee random politicianwhat the original meaning of orange color anyway the problem isn corruption the problem is we aren doing anything about the corruption how is the ganges doingthis government failed us on every single parameter now they want india to be fascist state this shit is getting bigger and bigger we have many issues to resolve but this is just burderning ourselves with load tons of turds don know what they want but the only thing that is clear that it is not peace well fuck this government funny this is just like what nationalists in northern ireland deal with man this is gold never seen an indian that muscleykisiko batana mat hindu rashtra aise banta hai banayega nahi koi if there was an image to sum up the current state of india this would be it hats off to the artist someone make t shirt on thisis this oc and could you provide link or an image that can share this picture is gem no words just feelings wish we could frame it in our way or could ve done something possibly the color which indicates strength and courage is now depicting something worse maybe lack of unity imandthisisdeepa perfect example of picture is worth thousand words narendra modi has been exactly what india represents the people with absolute zero tolerance of other religion culture or cast sometimes laugh so hard when people say india is country of diversity and people embrace it it is full of horse shit nepal neighbouring country of india can teach many things about developing tolerace and in society it is much smaller country than india but d argue even more diverse until and unless indian society learns to develop tolerance towards each other dont think there is any hope for the country and if tolerance is so far fetched the country should be divided into many small nations india never was single entity its been an extremely forceful unification so far and indians attitude towards their own dark skinned members lower caste uber hate for muslims and vice versa north south division hate and down pointing languages in every conversations small to big towards people of low class and occupation like auto driver security guard and others reek of very unhealthy society that shouldn live together not to mention there is almost zero respect for anything outside familiar zone from indians be it respect for others on road mall que differently looking and speaking people or foreigners and poverty and lack of education is such bullshit excuse for it there are many nations poorer and less educated than indians but have much more functioning civilized society and have much more potential in them such as nepal think india as whole is failed nation and society it would be much better if they divide and form small nations that will find their way to development in homogeneous way without having to develop tolerance which evidently indians fundamentally and painfully lack man this subreddit is so goddamn better than indians on twittermota bhai laughs in communalism op could you give credit to the person who made this at least put her name on the titlei wish could give you an award do you even know what the colors mean this truly sums up what have been feeling lately ye desh sirf bhagva nhi tha na hi hona chahiye this country is not just saffron nor it should be our diversity is our strengthall my emotions and fears put together into single picture if they can be put that way this will be the one although felt green should also have been used nevertheless it cannot be conveyed better than this picture think now want to express my thoughts want to speak out in my own words think after looking at this picture got the courage to say few know it isn something new m going to talk about word out already rahul bajaj show of courage had strong impact on me still do want to say it in my language believe we should stand stand together and ask for change if our freedom fighters could do when the media penetration was at it nasent stage with the number and variety of mediums we have the impact can be much more faster stronger at the same time deep down can truly say most of us are not ok with the internal situation of the country probably ir is being handled the best now can say categorically outside asia but inside we have become mess big mess there are many who still say what wrong did they do that you re so against them believe one can realize this themselves just hope it not late by then m worried about the path were walking on and at the same time scared to express my views and speak out in fear of becoming target may sound unreal but this is what my feeling is it doesn matter whether you re inside the system or not you will be dealt with if you stand against the regime however small and genuinely irrelevant your action be you will be labeled potential threat if you speak against the one in power so that the possibility fear of and who gave them this power us the kind of mandate we gave them that the root whatever they re doing it didn come out of nowhere they re true to their word actually whatever was presented in their manifesto they re executing all of them knowing all of this the people who voted so ardently from every part of the country the number apparently is so huge that can separate them from the rest and speak so it all of us who are responsible read these lines somewhere recently the problem with government of the people by the people and for the people is the people it may sound irrelevant and vague but seeing the situation we re in it sounds very true and relatable don like being called an anti national so believing that won be labeled as one want to share this with my people to whomever can and help them think and act so that can become we because only then there will be change no every fundamentalist deserves this imgur com kvsln pngsaffron for sacrifice isn it dayum this is amazing have always said and will say it again modiandhissupportersaretoindiawhattrumpandhissupportersaretoamericaand your point is cab and nrc has nothing to do with indian muslims as most are claiming it to be and it not about hinduism it has got to do with the minorities of our neighbours muslims voted for seperation and got it now when some of them are facing the heat should we really let them in point out one law which is against the muslim community of india if you are talking about the economic issue totally agree that the government is not doing enough in that front but when it comes to other nationalist policies it does deserve full marks stop this drama do an offline survey and see for yourself how much support this bill has in public fock modi and his views and his policiesnice art would have preferred squished ashokra chakra though deleted don know why but this relates to so many things masterpiece no matter what the religion it manages to make people dumb amd dumber well this pic is highly offensive

story of the german student forced to leave after caa protests www reddit com india comments efyi story of the german student forced to leave after another nail in the coffin for making indian universities global but go on tell me how the bjp is for development the fact that how bjp under its sheer arrogance is not for single second concerned about india international reputation baffles me they just think sending modi to every country every other day and he by forcefully hugging grabbing their pm presidents and by those hand scarring handshakes india will become the vishwaguru in response to now deleted comment m fucking sure they would parade him around instead if he participated in pro caa protests this government doesn follow the rules it just does whatever the fuck it finds convenient but for sure they ll tell people they re just following rules similar logic for police are beating up people because of violent protests btw instead of uae why don you compare with other countries like the usa or even germany where indian students on student visas have been on protests before you should stop being fucking fascist and apologise for the crimes this government commits this gives germany the moral right to expel all indian students they won because they aren stupid but this can lead to an ugly diplomatic situation when jaishankar was given the ea portfolio was happy felt these were signs that modi shah finally realised that foreign policy needs to be handled with more prudence and jaishankar given free reign is more than capable to ensure that could vouch for it having followed the guy actions for the past six years ever since the devyani khobragade incident happened but was wrong he is just another pawn who is being forced to say and do whatever modi shah want whatever he has said and done as eam does not reflect him at all in all of this chaos see that goa is uninterrupted and unaffected was in goa the last couple of days and it was so chill and out of this bullshit the multiple levels of irony in deporting german student at protest warning us about nazism while at iit madras an institution built with the help of germany thanks to bunch of insecure fascists whose founding fathers were inspired by the nazisevery major law modiji makes is new way to take away rights hope people realise that from demo gst to nrc he is chipping away at the rights of citizens and states in this case there was no reason to infringe on this guy freedom to participate in peaceful protest you just made it something bigger instead of letting it be token protest hero this is the way india will become vishwa guru this is the way india will spread the message of vasudhaiv kutambakam he was deported because it was stated in his visa terms and conditions that he should not be part of any protests in india as part of his stay he broke that part of his visa validity requirement and it was revoked man woukd be careful if went to any other country their terms and conditions ought to be respected just because it right doesn mean it legal and legality rules not righteousness and can think why this rule exists for good reason to prevent foreign powers from misusing the absence of this law and send in their citizens to participate in protests of local region and destabilize the governance of the region he really liked india guess the guy chose frooti over other drinks iit madras exists because of germany btwupvoting for reach not coz liked this study at iit and the authorities at iits are like bitch to government they don speak out on issues related to government nor they promote or protect students having critical comments about government because after all the funding comes from the center german student at iit madras not forced out was going home for christmas anyway mha www reddit com india comments efox german student at iitmadras not forced out was utm source reddit androidif join protest in germany ill probably get same treatmentwhat does foreigner have to do with countries internal affairs he has come as student then study and leave if ur not citizen of the country then have no right to poke ur nose in its internal affairs cant go to germany and suddenly without any prior knowledge start speaking against the government decisions while it is very sensible and moral to allow him to protest we must remember that foreigners do not enjoy article as per our constitution right to protest is derived from article the polity of nation is based on precedents and so just like the argument that caa sets bad precedent allowing foreigner to protest sets bad precedent toowhen students from developed nations seek education in third world country we send them back shame on this govt and shame on iit madras for letting this happen for those who don know any foreign student who participates in political protests will be expelled is theprint publishing unverified stories theprint in india german student at iit madras not forced out was going home for christmas anyway mha that german was more indian than some indians deleted feels bad for him nglbjp must be banif you went to study in germany and took part in anti government protest they will deport you back to india just sayin well he going to miss fruitythis sucks imagine the same thing happening but only they are sent to so called detention camps that what we are facing boys unless our protests come through ironically by deporting him back government just made big point it just proved that they can be irked by single person this is like when year old kid tries to piss off an adult and adult instead of ignoring him actually gets agitated says something about the so called adult same would happen if any indian student studying in germany would protest against german government why all this fuss over this guy everyone citing visa rules and everything knows that it would not have happened if he would have participated in pro nrc protests fuck bjp and fuck modi and most importantly screw pos amit shah like literally the worst of the worst scumbags ve ever seen in my years of existence the amount of degenerates who support this govt blindly and especially the nris just baffles me used to love this party when the late atal bajpayee was at the helm it just painful to see how much latent hatred and fascism people have in their hearts in the st century india is joining the muslim genocide trainmaybe this was his plan all along can afford ticket home so join protest to get deported home safely at no cost before christmas hmmmmmmguests don interfere in host internal affairsnow expel all the indian students deleted for all my anti bjp stance believe this was correct same will happen if you visit germany as student and speak about politics it non of his business here in india keralites from dubai has also been jailed fined lac each and banned for life for protesting in dubai don german college kids get better loans sadmodiji

respond to this though all the comments are detailed and descriptive but tend to wander off from the subject matterthanks for the gold kind stranger will pass on the generosity to someone good job india it is informed prior to issuing of the visa not to participate in these kind of things politics aside our students going germany to study and german students coming india to study and here our mom dad thinks goin abroad will make bright future who make them understand that their abroad students coming here to study think cid mier got it right when used to play civ india becomes fundamentalist at end of times and starts nuking everyone unfortunate right decision by goi india is not banana republic it billion strong largest peaceful functional democracy the way indian students behave in foreign countries foreign students must respect indian laws however genuine the cause may be remember even our president business leaders ministers had to follow the strict protocols and could not protest only pity him for his stupidity and sympathise for his misfortune you come to my house and see me beating my wife and kids you protest tell you to leave my house am wrong germany allows lots of syrian and other refugees from different countries and which led to serious violence as well however have never heard any mass movement or more so students coming out on street in fact all tier universities in the world never seen to be part of any movement against political or other government decisions they express dissent however in india not only dissent they also come out in street no wonder we don have too many tier universities bottom line is keep politics out of campus but do express opinions it a visa rule deleted blyat not againif he was from pakistan then we would have given him citizenship lolmerry crisis and happy new fear like this hindustan will be free from those mugalswhy he is leaving shame on such guys who don even understand the actual meaning of caa it feels good to see such people getting deported there is something called rules if you violate the terms you re out no need to impress this on germans they love following rules sour grapes my friend rules don care how you feel they re just rules so if this fella was from se asia pretty he would ve been departed by our honest to god police then deny that they did it since he is german first world place not to mess with the coward modi sent him right back to his country without any charges yeah bye bye boy go protest in your own country and see what they do to you germany doesn have freedom of expression so keep your contempt in your own country he strangely looks like an indian deporting him will create bad image for india because he ll obviously spread the word the news has already reached usa wonder what gonna happen next also wonder whats the future of this young mangood fucking riddance when you re student in another country you stfu and study you don take sides doesn he know that freedom of speech is limited in the country plus what was he expecting global education by getting degree in india put some money in your degree and get it from college in europe who is much more qualified and well equipped than the lower grade indian universities rules are rules but cops should ve gone after rapists and other scumbags plus there are enough corrupt politicians this german dude was legal immigrant he didn sneak into india without documents yup he broke rule by protesting but he was legal until that point fuck rules are rules don get why people are people are protesting against cab and caa how can people be so jobless firstly don go to other countries on temporary students visa and break law by getting involved in political matter of that country when have nothing to do with it but m curious why foreigner want be involved in political matter of some other countries when gandhiji protested in africa he became god when he is protesting in india he is sent back what tribute to gandhi on his th birth year india is on its way to becoming fascist state the people must rise up against it yes we should protest against the constitution and its details all police force is wrong he must have had all the documents and was living legally in the county for sure and we know for sure the fact that how bjp follows the supreme court and implemented better police system is very worry some xb its very sad to see police is working and following the ipc and constitution all because of bjp we just need our original corrupt police who does no work and we just want to criticize about police and when police works we will blame the politicians who is germany to interfere in india policy they don live here and don know the ground realities and history he will protest here about indonesia policies and then go back to the luxury and peace of germany without caring about the consequences of his recommendation this is going to really hurt your economy india they don

people and ve honestly never felt so patriotic time to reclaim our national flag and our national anthem from the sangh parivar m dumb american what are they protesting not allowing muslims to immigrate rest of the country can go long way in learning from mumbai how to organise democratic march police is actually doing its job of maintaining law and order and de escalating potentially troublesome situation people are peacefully protesting instead of rioting and arsoning sight to behold for ages the better side of mumbai spirit dear bjp majority of the people voted for you to give you the upper hand in making government that could bring peace and prosperity to themselves as well as to their nation please keep aside your vendetta for the actions that had happened more than years ago and focus on the future also if put forward choice between peace and prosper majority of us would take the the peace deleted woah seems like good number even this picture doesn capture the grandness of the protest was there and experienced it in its grandeur this is just fraction of people living in mumbai rest are sitting at home enjoying the show that majority is gonna support modi always so he doesn have to worry about this this people will get tired in some days just matter of few days before attention will move on to other things modiji should only worry if all the population is against him majority is in favor with him making him still in safe zone prepare to have your internet shut down because the government can handle criticism had this discussion with someone in the morning who was supporting this bill he was arguing on the lines that this would scare more illegal immigrants in the future the long term thinking blah blah after silence said okay sounds fair and good but why allow hindus and other immigrants minus muslims and give them citizenship now it was his turn to remain silent further added and for that had to wear my bhakts level stupid hat okay lets not beat around the bush we want muslims out of india completely and intend to make it hindu nation period that will make us super power like china or saudi arabia as we will become one religion nation only one religion must have an upper hand even though we already have the upper hand since maharajah and mahatma era till now however we always have that piles on our hindu butthole that muslims still exists here and they have rights as well they take our jobs and eat vegetables and grains that our hindu farmers produce mean we fear that since muslims over populate by having wives and grandchildren our share of land is taken away like babri masjid matter ever land of ours is hindu land so as rss wants say out of crores indians let remove crores muslims and throw them at pakistan afghanistan iran etc etc now the remainder is crores indians we still remain over populated our conditions still remains the same or worse modi promised crores jobs every year to let say hindus only as he prefers he didn even create lakhs of jobs in years properly how will this bill will help us grow our economy and how will that help in development furthermore we will create more enemies and terrorists out of thrown out muslims cuz we always say they are terrorists fine out of crores we threw out let say crores muslims picks up weapons and intrude india we don even have lakhs personnel in the army how will we control crores pissed off and homeless hopeless muslims our civilians will pick up weapons our hindu civilians who never picked up any guns as we like to call ourselves global messenger of peace right and not to mention the whole country will be war throughout the years and forget gdp we won even have an economy we don have an economy right now the rich of india are indians by skin but americans canadians britishers and other first world country citizens they are just like mark zukerberg ronald mcdonald and akshay kumar who think of india as business dealing country not residents they will back off and will drop their indian ness like whore drops her panties when they see india has gone to utter shit and fighting what will you and as hindu rashtra citizen will do emigrate he remained quiet and left after my lecture to him m still hoping that he thinks more deeply about it and not take it as lightly as the bhakts and it cells are trying to make it like demonitization tomorrowland indiareminds me of when hk protests startedwhat are they protesting that not lot considering the population for all it could be people from one apartment no citizens of

yes give em hell is that cloud or smoke that is making that photo cloudyworld revolution mumbai is awake great to see such unity see no differencestay strong mumbai taken from shripati arcade name of the building people of our country should always keep in mind the learnings from mahatma gandhi that one should always go with non violence its very shocking to see people burning cars motorbikes houses etc out of it more shocking is the reaction from the police the government is instructing the police so harshly that they are even shooting teenagers and other protesters just to make fear in the hearts of the people that the government can do anything the establishment of citizen act is very undemocratic and seems to be dictator move and beyond all this violence and protest by the voters there is no action to call off the law from the government democratic rule is said to be rule of the people by the people for the people but it seems that the rule is not just for the wellbeing of the citizens but to make divisions our fundamental laws says right to secularism but now directly or indirectly in the coming future it is turning out that the law will break we as citizens should now be educated enough not to discriminate on the behalf of religion and should unite and live something similar is going on in delhi also would like to attach video but dont know how honestly like hate

effort to at least just listen to the ones protesting and then debate upon it it so bad that normal indian citizens are justifying the attrocities being commited on the students everyone just resorts to name calling and labelling fuck this shit honestly fuck bjp and fuck amit shah and his lackeys meanwhile police thought that man is anurag thakur this looks like well orchestrated plan but terribly executed did all notice what the cops were doing while he was terrorizing ppl and the urgency to take him somewhere once he shot padma nationalist jihadi what breaks my heart is this guy is it just shows you how fascism as an ideology can brainwash someone so bad he should be playing cricket having his first crush studying for board exams what is wtong with our society in which year old thinks he is victim and needs to solve things with gun come shoot me asshole great bjp has found its cm candidate for delhi elections if this is happening in broad daylight in delhi think it time to start calling india basket case and club it with pakistan and afghanistan as failed countries regardless of your political affiliation utter failure of law and order in the country capital is shameful signhave look at what republic tv has to sayis this country on the brink of civil war your opinions please ab ho gayi tumhari fence sitting and centrism hope your decency saves your ass when you get shot like this all of you lot defending goswami yesterday are complicit in this even now republic is running lines saying that the shooter was protester fucking bastards twitter com ani status delhi the student injured after man brandished gun and opened fire in jamia area today he has been admitted to hospital the man who had opened fire has been taken into police custody and is being questioned can even hold gun properly or hide hid identity sadak chap bhakt who believes in dumb shit and is born to follow stupid people delhi police be like chota aadmi gundai karna chahta hai karne do that what the idea of new india is all about curse on the fucktards who voted fascists the blood is on your hands shitheads wtf happening in my country so what this is s now just saw anjana om modi trying to justify this cowardly act on her so called debate how low this people can stoop youtu be vwrlcajgw youtu be vwrlcajgw m surprised that the gun even works m even more surprised at the fact that the fucking cops are standing right fucking behind him this has to make it to allgodse version can anyone help in bringing international media coverage for this news know al jazeera has reported this but if someone can tag the news to washington post don think this is just because of some minister instigating violence ministers have been doing this kind of shit earlier too whether left or right imo the main culprit here is the media for an average working middle class man news channels on their television is their main source of consuming what happening in the country the media now has become so biased that it keeps on feeding single opinion in the minds of these people know people who just watches these channels and their hatred of other religions is just very concerning if this happened in us this guy would ve been shot by the police that an homemade gun or katta that boys going to be in jail for long time originally wanted to say chaddi terror but think really need to stop sugarcoating it at this point this is basically hindutva terror exactly similar to islamic terror worse thing is when the real terrorists are the government itself while these are just fodder cannon it was the people who were brave who stood their ground if someone pulled out gun in front of bhakts unn ki toh chadi phat jaati madarchod sale this is what you get when your ministers blatantly say they ll shoot the protestors looks like they want something akin to the hong kong protests asshole has the most punchable face people from the tatti sub think this shooter was planted by aap and the worst part is they are seriously thinking about such possibility how radicalized are they that they just refuse to see the truth the way the cop grabbed him looked like bas yaar chal chai peete hai is police in ncr only for parade terrorist hope this madness stops here jamia student shot during anti caa peace march accused detained the shooter is juvenile this is what hindutva has done to this society pretty sure this hindu terrorist has become hero for many what patriot just like godse now arrest every sanghi mp minister who incited this violence with slogans like desh ke gaddaron ko goli maro salon ko and prosecute them using the strongest provisions of the law for inciting violence being accessories to attempted murder etc let see if they get at least as severe punishment as the man who called doorknob coward this guy is terrristlet be fair he is doing what the police does but without any uniform hindutva terror is real and bigger threat to this country tattispeaks calling it fake as he fired at the arm of the protestor new levels sharjeel called for chakka jam no chakka jam took place booked for sedition kafeel khan said nothing booked for inciting violence anurag thakur chanted goli maaro saalo ko one terrorist shot at jamia protesters but no action against thakur law is equal for everyone another godse is born cut one head off two will take it place hail hydra why can we call him hindutva terrorist yeh jo dehshatgardi hai uske peeche wardi hai years ago person known for non violent protest was gunned down by hindu fanatic and today people who don learn from the mistakes in history are bound to repeat them that a gun both iamatotalpieceofshit and ormil gaya vikas xb so this is new india hmmm chalo bhyi get ready for genocide will the injured person family

they failed in doing their duty shouldn they be fired ps how is the police behaviour here justify their salaries told you told you guys see nazi hit nazi am an outsider can somebody send link or something that explains what is going on india haven heard single thing about it but this seems serious this stunts will go on because it is government sponsored the only end is replacing the shit government that has turned out country into shithole appreciate the camera man who was fearless at the right position with correct resolution opposite to the gun man he shot correctly before he might get shot media year old mentally unstable teenager poor guy police we were metres away and he had his back turned to us we couldn see any gun don know what is more dangerous if he is bjp sent guy or if he is genuinely gone bonkers listening to shah and other bjp propaganda day and night this is the direct result of amount of hatred that is being spread unfortunately people are not able to understand the game that is being played and get used this guy has probably destroyed his career and life after what he has done air knobi am happy the reddit community is intelligent hope it won

such take stock of situation and discredit extremist views so when is he going to get an mla or mp seat aisa koun krta hai yr pta ni yahan chal kya rha hai india me expected turn off events after this the man was policeman supporter deployed among protestors in civilian clothes and was forced to use his weapon when heckled cornered by the protestors aap chronology samajhiye that one weird looking gunand police just watches the kind of outrage came across on the post on the kunal kamra arnab goswami incident here on reddit and the ingenuity of arguments that got to see where people sprung to defend the right of the esteemed journalist and the kind on this thread shows all that wrong with this country we are so doomed headed right towards genocide in the guise of civil war and to all those thinking these are truly acche din you re complicit isse do azaadiaaaaand he a minor whats the protest about the fact that this happened on the day mahatma gandhi was assassinated is even more spine chilling on jan years and we are back where we started not long before we head into civil war we should stop all that shit now apart of all that things we should focus on educational problems and many more which our country have accidentalrennaissacewhat in the world those cops doing only waiting to get paid jokes apart but the kind of hatred these cockroaches have spread in our country will lead to serious consequences this shooting sedition cases against school children and what not have advised my kid not to speak for or against anyone you never know when the inflated ego of our pm might get hurt if this bastard is let off without punishment am sure usa like gun culture and shooting innocent people will be prevalent in india too and on the anniversary of gandhis death no less these scum are repeating their actions all over againyo that dude called me to talk about extending my cars warranty think he said his name was robert here is the copy of my police complaint over the

good entertainment isn it while the police watches silently sadis he using the bolter pistol from outer worlds aise logon se hi sabse bada khatra hai iss desh ko ridiculous that is very curious

traitors next indian prime minister you want azzadi ye lo azaadi seems like he took those memes seriously what the hell kind of gun is that thought events like this would never again unfold in our

al conversation and not get thrashed by the senseless public in india never believe and trust ps police and politicians media is on another level altogether injustices galore rape murder and gore bishada or bangalore enough crore any whore society rotten to its core twitteratis smash keyboards in uproar tepid tempers soar on the parliament floor black coats and waistcoats in khadi who swore while cammo and khakhi score belt out injustices more and more page after page of our samvidhan is being tore most sleep and snore until shit hits their shore if not yet numbed or bore humanity is within act or explore human more human more it a fake encounter but goddam this pleases my soul did we know the names of the accused are we sure the same people were killed who were accused sounds like fake encounter the commissioner was involved in something eerily similar earlier too he was the sp that time when there was an encounter that killed the warangal acid attack perpetrators www indiatoday in latest headlines story andhra police kill youths involved in acid attack www indiatoday in latest headlines story andhra police kill youths involved in acid attack well now it official our courts are useless and do justice with no one its sad day even the police has lost faith in courts mere desh ki dharti lynching ugle ugle fake encounters mere desh ki dharti why bother keeping people in prisons when you can simply execute them in fake encounters these motherfuckers are going to get away with it aren they they ll even get medals and promotions for this reckon this looks like cold blooded murder of bunch of people dragged from slum to cover up real rapists low iq masses are celebrating this jfl am the only one that more bothered by the potential cover up and protection of someone powerful than the blatant fake encounter did they release any of the evidence against the aaccused was anything corroborated by national agency as well before get downvoted by some bhakts just ask yourself what proof the cops have shown cops covering up for each other and powerful politicians and rich assholes is nothing new in our country in fact it happens in countries like america as well not to mention murdering innocent people to protect the guilty what we need is complete transparency just like in the gang rape case in delhi all sims geo location data near the vicinity of the victim all dna evidence if there was any remaining even if they burned her so there was nothing left there could still be some left on the accused and their clothes we need fucking transparency not the regular narrow minded blind brigading see in toi comments tried looking for anything but can find any other than mention of mechanic that suspected these guysthis feels like sacred gameslooks like jeffrey epstein wrote this plot linethis is not at all good all it does is sets precedent for the public to engage in taking the law into their hands for future such cases now what if some new evidence comes to light which proves anyone of the accused was innocent and the police beat him up and forced confession out of him in exchange of money to his family because this is indian police we are talking about this shouldn have happened also who the fucks takes all of the accused to the crime scene to recreate the crime any police worth their salt would take the weakest of the accused because he ll be the one who can be trusted this is terrible the rapists deserved public death fake encounters don enforce our belief in the justice system kcr is basically amit shah with an uglier nose perhaps lynching them thus will pacify people if not he is going to suspend the officers till the outrage dies down or simply do the unthinkable transfer themfake encounter we ve been reading this in china and more recently in hong kong are we turning away from democracy judicial system and surrendering to public outrage this feels right momentarily although it isn right the law is not yet changed india still doesn enforce fatal punishment against heinous crimes more just way would be to bring them to court and then be hanged understand the judicial system is slow and people believe culprits would have evaded punishment eventually but law amendment is required for democracy to function and prosper taking control in own hands by police or public is anarchy democracy will fall apart an example would be nirbhaya case of the juvenile yo rapist could not be persecuted as an adult but his crime was worth conviction yes our blood boiled instead of taking matter into our own hands we let legislation take care of this new amendment was passed within days of the convicts release from juvenile prison today juveniles will be treated as adults for such heinous crimes he couldn be convicted back then but today if such crime repeats nobody can evade talking about hyderabad case no corrective action has been taken yet let wait and watch what happens now anyone who thinks justice was done or the cops are heroes the four accused got off easy had due legal course taken place they would have been rotting in jail for lifetime every day regretting the monsters they became this is just an easy exit for them and had the same cops acted in time on the fateful maybe she would have been alive nothing good has come out of this whole sordid affair kya chutiya kaat rahe hai bc wtf is this some autocracy so we understand police brutality in usa but celebrate extrajudicial killings in india should we just forget ryan school murder case now smell rat and the crowd goes wild seeing all the positive reaction to this news all over social media is heartbreakingkcr probably got tired of people complaining about him attending weddings while the case was unsolved so the case was solved anyway approve screw those people now if we can do the same thing with that dipshit in unnao if this is fake encounter would the cops fake the murders last time saw something like this was in ab tak chappani don think all of them should even be taken to the same spot it harder to believe these tried to outrun the police or even attack them forget self defense or shooting them down to not let them free did the police not think of the backlash for being clumsy in allowing them chance to escape or attack in the first place the coverup is the most hilarious thing heard today think they should give us detailed evidence about the encounter but sadly that not gonna happen believe it or not extra judicial killings are being more more acceptable in the civil society this is failure by both the police and the judicial system if these rapists were allowed to go to the court they would drag the case for years m not saying what the police did was right the police took the law in their own hands this won stop future rapes from happening really this is the shit from movies m sure they just killed them why would they be taken there how did they run if they were cuffed the worst part is most people praise this we ve finally reached point where the government can murder anyone and still have the support of the citizens also what if they were innocent that a basic constitutional right innocent until proven guilty that why laws even fucking exist most likely the government killed some random people so that the case would hush down straight out of the plot of gangajal where bacha yadav kills thugs gifted by sadhu yadav an eye for an eye okay my first reaction to this is pure happiness and the feeling of closure and justice being done for the girl family but seriously though this sort of extra judicial self action by police is big symptom of the rotten malaise that plagues the criminal justice system in the country anyway m glad the victim family at least have some closure as per the law and some lawyers claims that this was against the law but this whole process seems like jolly llb plot telangana police implement plot successfully in real case hooly shitthe mob is rome he who controls them controls everything new spot where they killed in encounter twitter com ani status dingo ate my baby and this is current state of our local telugu media www youtube com watch zazhwqyago feature youtu be www youtube com watch zazhwqyago feature youtu be the reporter went on to interview one of the accused mother where she was clearly seen crying that she cant take it anymorethe new discussion topic for modia for next week or so they ll brand those cops as heros while our judiciary stays blind and dumb once proven guilty it should have been the outcome but before the due process how can you kill someone granted the judicial system is tortoise but you can go past the law just because you are emotionally driven getting shot dead was an easy escape for them they deserved stricter harsher and more enduring this was too quick this is such sad day for india police killing sorry encountering suspects and people celebrating this all four are dead police suddenly has become the best aim no one injured even if gravely the whole thing is fishy and it really sad to see people defend the police who did this benefit no changes to law against rapists they still won get capital punishment if anything police depts in other regions will try to emulate this cause they want adulation too and they will decide and execute more suspects no need to prove someone did the crime will the police still prove in court the four were the actual criminals we ll never know if they were the real criminals these could have been innocent men and the real culprits might be back on the streets few years ago saw the movie bridge of spies it story about russian spy caught in the usa this person is possibly the reason for the death of many americans and has leaked many classified us military documents to his homeland russia you know how the greatest democracy in the world responded by giving him fair trial believe the culprits got what they deserved but it would have been better if this castigation was led by our judicial system instead of public sentiment if we cannot trust our justice system then maybe we should first bring amends to it else what is the difference between us and barbaric country make the problem so severe that the people will have to accept anything you give them great tactics ,Politics
pro gamer move by women of bangalore in student led protest courtesy of section of code of criminal procedure www reddit com india comments ednt progamer move by women of bangalore in a student epic gamer moment for women bruh moment for policeforeigner here women can be arrested at night in india that an actual law bhakths wait are they using formation from mahabarat against us goddamnit what have we done also look at our anti establishment journalists most are women despite what they re subjected to on social media legends all of them more power to everyone participating especially the women this gave me chills that worked because it was not in uttar pradesh or delhi for that matterhaha not just modi and shah can play with the loopholes of law and order you go girls continue the protestswell as per my understanding of how this country works this rule is applicable only till there are camera around otherwise sab ko danda padta hai no matter what gender proof of this actually taking place during the protest http imgur com gallery vwmtkp fucking nice this made me smile nglwait women can be touched by police when the sun is down first question why second question there gotta be some funny stories of abusing this loophole right this is beautiful and powerful af is this the greatest country in the world or whatwhy doesn the government use female police officers in order to arrest beat deal with female protesters bhakts wait that is illegal naari shakti they used the system to fight the system thats really nice to hear women empowerment we should be nonviolent in the protests so that government hear what we want them to hear and do what we want them to do after all india is democratic nationproud of my country women are angels it feels bad that they don get the respectwouldn work in north indiaproud and glad it was very cash money of them this is just awesome brought tears to my eyes how to exploit loophole in all seriousness appreciate the women involvement and ingenuity in this scenario waoooo amazing hey know this guy this is sumthing called true unity good job if there were female police officers they could have easily been arrested as sec is imposed heres the exact law save in exceptional circumstances no woman shall be arrested after sunset and before sunrise and where such exceptional circumstances exist the woman police officer shall by making written report obtain the prior permission of the judicial magistrate of the first class within whose local jurisdiction the offence is committed or the arrest is to be made still kudosgreat to see

re gonna get out of this weird mess we ve made on this planet bring on the matriarchy bring it on now it pretty cool but why is such rule implemented in the first place isn this sexist what if the woman is murderer or commited some other crime imagine not arresting them just because sun wasn out or are there any more clauses to this an explanation would be awesome big brain damn that coolas satish shah said in ddlj you re not only genius but indigenous win at so many levels was there gotta say it was pretty good epic gamer momentthis warms my cold heartamazing display of bravery and intelligence will even make cops realise that they should think about whats happening and why its happening instead of simply following orders by their serniors actually these women are making an excellent case for how these gender protection laws are bullshit and can be abused against law enforcement not sure why you people think it makes women look good here they re openly showing everyone that they re exploiting law meant for their protection against the police in ridiculous ways let me ask what happens if someone is literally getting mobbed to death but ring of women is surrounding the mob what happens do the police just stand down while the murderers are escorted to safety by the women absurd i don think the law works that way if remember correctly if you have atleast one policewoman they can arrest her but they have to detain them separately in women exclusive place and the law also mentions that in exceptional cases you can arrest women and there is no list of exceptional cases given so think it very subjective oh how this gives me hope in this god forsaken country more power to our women absolute class women can be arrested before sunrise or after sunset all could just kill someone and have free hour head start to dip why am crying what were they protesting for love it having heard about increasing number of false dowry cases and other gender biased laws being misused by few women it amazing to hear one being used for positive outcome hope more and more people stand up for the right thing mein toh tandoori murgi hu yaar gatkale ise alcohol se tf women can be arrested at some particular time excerpt from crpc chapter save in exceptional circumstances no women shall be arrested after sunset and before sunrise and where such exceptional circumstances exist the woman police officer shall by making written report obtain the prior permission of the judicial magistrate of the first class within whose local jurisdiction the offence is committed or the arrest is to be made am so proud of every girl who is fighting fascism right back here modern problems require modern solutionsmodern problem requires modern solutions uhhhwhag modern problems require modern solutionsthis is hilariousootl foreigner what are they protesting women of our country are nothing like they show in our movies that both smart and inspiring the real women of india modern problems require modern solutionswhy cant women be arrested at night til women can be arrested in the dark please don tell my wife thathappenedmisusing loophole in the law meant to protect women to prevent law enforcement officers from doing their duty good job god made males females to complement each other differences and work cooperatively politicians mainstream media promote feminism to get males and females to compete against each other and be consumed by the cycle of hatred fear is the path to the dark side fear leads to anger anger leads to hate hate leads to suffering suffering leads to more fear no thanks don do anything that could get me killed or arrested not worth it if country doesn wanna change then m not gonna bother m on this earth for more years tops with the way things are going int he world maybe less not gonna waste my time trying to change something can change life way to short to be worried about politics or anything of the sort saving men from going against the constitution why is no one else talking about how this is screenshot of an instagram post which was screenshot of facebook post yeah because the men or so called man like to hit police with stones but are shitscared when the police try to hit them and you are fighting for freedom while you can even tolerate single beating imagine if that how bharat singh and chandrashekhar azad tried to protest against the britishtime to change that rule now lmaoreally bro why re women not able to be arrested during these times don women want equality doesn seem equal if men can get arrested but women can breaking laws is women empowerment nice what the hell kind of rule is women cant be arrested before sunrise or after sunset that objectively stupid,Politics

found my autograph diary while going through some of my old stuff here is dr kalam autograph took years ago www reddit com india comments fyc found my autograph diary while going through some he had come to my school but teachers only introduced their favorite students cried for two days after couldn meet him was heartbroken can you show us what other autographs you have too shut up take this diary and frame it in thick plate something to be preserved and what great man he was it a good thing he isn here to see this nation today where did you meet him op this is gold was just planning to read his autobiography again today hey op please get it framed just president of india my man you are underselling him was lucky enough to see him at two feet distance when he came to our college in mumbai in he was swarmed by security as he was leaving the college and got close to him as can beholding his glorious mop of white hair never has the death of person who don know saddened me as much as dr kalam did though not comparable understood how millions of indians felt when gandhi died or americans when hearing that kennedy was assassinated have said this before and will say this at every opportunity get want apj abdul kalam on my currency notes this makes me so sad back in class was bright student always taking part in extracurricular activities apart from getting top grades once dr kalam visited our school but the children of teachers were chosen to welcome him cried horribly after the incident did somebody else write the name and date or did he use different ink for some reason kalam ke kalam sehey it my birthday date laughed seeing the non political flair on this post after all this man name is pulled into every hindu muslim debate banter fight in vain considering dr kalam this is memory to treasure lucky youpress for the man who was the rocket man of india the og goat would definitely pay for something like that but how can anyone put price on that get it framed or something that priceless you must frame this dude making this sit in some junk is serious crime as see it love how no nonsense your autograph book is that preciousthats sooo coool man he was good man ah before selfieswould have better if he left his lineage behind the country is just going down the whirlpool nevertheless reskept his decision ps it probably is notepad think you should frame it noice put it in some safe or something away from dust you can make nice ornamentry show case for bragging points wow lucky you you got treasurewow my first ever award on reddit thank you so much random human you just put smile on my face hope great things happen to you man no one collects autographs any more such lost artframe that you monster for first and last time indians felt they really have presidentoh shit remember having an autograph diary which originally got at disney world as kid for all the disney characters but then was mainly filled with cricket players definitely had kapil dev and sachin tendulkar in there ve changed homes since then and cannot figure out where it might be nowa great indianand where exactly did you take it from put it for auction and raise some funds for fighting corona that lucky charm you are will never forgive that one day fell sick and he visited my school and lost my only chance to have met him in real life went to rameshwaram and met his brother thoughmustve been pretty cool meeting the presidemt that is worth keeping bro he is and will always be legend that awesome you should get this framed once the quarantine is overfind me someone who doesn love this manthis ia so wholesomethank god that master piece is still with you that gonna cherish your entire life remember when he came to my school in was boy scouts and greeted him was in rd grade and remember him telling me to tie my laces when went to college was bragging about meeting scientist who had worked with dr kalam and my friend pulled out picture of him with dr kalam that was the only time realised iits and nits are different from others awesomegoing through the comments looks like he didn visit only my school sigh mate that date looks familiar were you sankalp finalist and invited to the rashtrapati bhavan for tea and snacks after the competition too tbh apj is the only president since ve born that truly respect frame this immediatelyawesome guy great ngl was reading wings of fire currently dude with your permission may save this image to my photo collection dr kalam was the greatest human being have seen and will ever see in my lifetime wonder if dr kalam would have been allowed to raise voice against the growing muslim hate in this country or would the bjp it cell come forward with cooked up stories of how he sold military secrets to pakistan you took kalam autograph on that bas pagle pagli rulayega rulayegi kya chinookhow old are you now cried the day he left who else shouldn you have kept it safely or had it framed lockdown reviving memories this is amazing baseddude this is goldenif dr kalam knew that only selected creamy layer students are getting chance to meet him while thousands are being discarded he definately would go mad on the authorities and would ask them to make necessary changes but tbh he was on tour and with personality like him who wouldn want to meet him in person considering this don this selecting handful was bad move were you in bhartiya vidya bhavan pune vision f for dr kalamawesome feels like the current regime has reduced the powers of the president it took me five minutes to recall the name of the current president aaj dr kalam hote toh yeh hindu muslim politics ko dekh ke bahut rote india was supposed to be superpower by we let him down when are you getting modiji autographnice best can do is

superheroes in their capes the ones who fought the crypto battle for billion people because of them bitcoin is now legal to trade in india www reddit com india comments fdsru superheroes in their capes the ones who fought some heroes wear capes as well hooray for the who know about it and the who use it ok just tell me how to dig them now time to get rich some one hire them for green battle benefits you know what mean billion lollooks like them washing powder nirma folksis this guerrilla marketing ad for tide there actually bit more court has accepted the argument of rbi that crypto are form of currency which is within the power of rbi to regulate it only struck down the blanket ban anyone taken in crypto should wait bit and see how the rbi reacts and any policy decisions that will surely be comingi am pretty sure most senior judges who banned cryptocurrencies and present cji dont know how to log in to mail kekla currency whose value is backed by wasted computer processing power and electricity bitcoin value might be sketchy but the ban saved lot of people from economic ruin because pundits couldn stop talking about this stuff on the internet and then everyone on the internet became crypto pundit know economists love speculation based trading but to anyone looking at the reversal of the ban as validation of bitcoin please don the ban was deemed unconstitutional does not mean that bitcoin is fair trade what it means is that people have the constitutional freedom to make bad life decisions honestly don see the point of getting into bitcoin now if you invested decade ago you have made lot of money but to mine bitcoin now profitably is very tough its also much much easier now to pay for stuff than it was decade ago because of stuff like paypal and upi for all the hubbub about how it a decentralised currency with no government influence or control its also very volatile really don see the point here that great news for india thank you and congrats they are even shiningwell appreciate and welcome the freedom to trade but bitcoin and other cryptos are nothing more than speculative bullshit decentralization has started people should start using crypto in india now am so glad with this news because now don have to do kyc for wallets such as paytm phonepe etc companies use our transaction data to deliver ads and government use it to track us but facebook must be happy with this decision as well they ll now release libra coin in india too which is bad to all the wet blankets who are disregarding btc usd inr today the government is constantly devaluing the currency to prop up india export based economy this usd being less valuable by the day due to inflation means that your rs will buy you wayyyy less also this money if kept in banks can be frozen at the government will anytime modiji is already up each indian ass anyway with aadhar bitcoin provides very valuable alternative to park cash for long term m not suggesting go nuts on it and that the stock market is scam it isn but an uncorrelated world wide asset currency is great hedge and it more convenient than holding gold in bank lockers which us indians are so used to think these heroes atleast deserve less exposed photohow is this good thing bitcoin is tremendously volatile commodity and also makes no sense you may think you understand unguaranteed currency but you don since bitcoin is not backed by any govt agency it is legal again understand it is legal to use all sorts of price manipulations like pump and dump who gets screwed with such strategies who should be protected from downfalls and who did these people fight for just don understand anyone interested in bitcoin should read the bitocin white paper to understand it then visit btcfork bitcoin has been taken over by those who bitcoin was supposed to inhibit the experiement is broken thoughwait so why was it illegal in the first place great to hear this is happening in india it obviously the country crypto needs for good scalability too bad the title is off though crypto is more than bitcoin and bitcoin is st generation is in the works now bitcoin is old news removed they saved many indian crypto startups lol the assertion that billion people give crap about crypto currency also love how we want to address black money and corruption but also want to legalize form of money whose whole selling point is that it is difficult to trackin other words they are pissing their lives away being stooges for the rich hoping for few crumbs from the master table you crazy capitalists and your slapstick shenanigans may they live to kick sicker rhymethis is really awesome can tell you how happy am right now can someone explain why this is worth such praise and how does it help our country needs more of such peoplethis victory not gonna last long bill banning all private cryptocurrencies is in drafting stage the very argument the lawyers gave that without any law in force central bank rbi can ban the cryptocurrencies on its own once the bill is passed by the parliament this argument won hold any ground now graphics cards will be more expensive just when you thought india had enough money that is no longer redeemable anywhereah see sarcasm is not big in india congrats and thanks to all invisible hero whom may not know but because of them some sanity do exist in this world we thank you all lawyers and specially ashim sood our cardano stake pool up in the himalayas can be legally operated going forwardgood work ma ppl blockchain is the future yes but the market doesn work that way sebi only approves where mutual fund can invest that is it states segments where the funds are being placed at not individual stocks it cannot control the hedging action done by mfs to keep the fund afloat that is where all the manipulation is done as long as the mf is afloat the securities company makes money however when you invest in stocks the general rule of thumb is to make profit and exit and loop this cycle know this for certain because worked as stock broker in one of the leading banks of the country is crypto rival to traditional fiat currency can it be converted to paper money didnt get it what if government makes legislation and pass in parliament to ban bitcoins what is the job of court is india the only country where supreme court decides to legalise lgbt community dictate height of human pyramid in dahi handi festival decides sound level which is optimum for public hearing and etc still think crytpocurrency aren good overall they may be used as an asset but they shouldn be used as trading currency they ll rival rupee and destabilize it don downvote for my opinions thank you they re stupid then crypto currency are just not necessary blockchain based currency transfer is great but we already have upi and everyone is using it now it make more sense to use blockchain in upi transactions cryptocurrency is just going to be used for illegal activities there is no reason for crypto currency to be mainstream they should ve kept it illegal at least transfer them some bitcoinsjust one word reliancewait was it illegal so far is bitcoin traceable no capes hope ab sarkaar na ungli kare otherwise we may need these heroes again finally now can accept payment in bitcoin and stop paying paypal percent have nothing else but respect for these guys thank you in upcoming times of financial turmoil bitcoin can act as safe hedge fight the fiatcos modi recalled all the real cashnirmawon it help political parties in funding black money thanks for supporting the dark net and actorsshould hire them to legalize porn industry in india can deal with the lack of representation of our country in that field in professional way billion wondering how much real impact does this have could it be that indians already trade btc using vpn etc oh yeah it was really important to make bitcoin legal than solving riots and stopping the capital from burningwooootso which crypto should invest in bitcoins are just glorified ponzi scheme what is it btw can wait for another politician to fall in bitcoin scam hope something similar happens when all the bs acts get challenged in sc anyone know the name of their firm can someone explain why its good idea to allow crypto when it is being used by lot of politicians for money laundering it could potentially lead to capital outflows as traders lose money in pump and dump schemes of international traders am stock market trader myself but know allowing bitcoin is anything but inviting misery deflationary currency is its own enemy and marginal traders can combat the whales in trading either time to figure out how to help politicians and businessmen do profitable money laundering let get rich bitcoin trading was legal before too however they weren legal tenders ban now they have become legal tenders now theres one more reason to visit goa next week apart from the beach relaxing shacks and mind numbing

point more anonymous transactions sure but apart from that don see the point please explain as far as making it legal am ok to call them heroes but in the larger context the concept of trading

was such that we could give atleast of land to them without proper road passing thru allow just few tourists in every season make non humans the ownersalbino white cubs are an indication of close genepool it kind of sad actually they don occur as frequently in nature as they do in captivity love the fact that we as nation really care about our animals we should really have programs that eventually release them in the wild can imagine the life they ll have in cages word cloud out of all the comments imgur com iippx png fun bot to vizualize how conversations go on reddit enjoythe father needs to ask some questions awwi just want to hold them in my hand feel their furr and purr they are so beautiful they re not born to be in cage or zoo please don support this please educate yourselves if the following is news to you white tigers are bred despite having myriad of health problems and not living nearly as long as normal tigers kidney and spine issues crossed optic nerves etc white tigers is sign of bad zoo unless it a sanctuary rescuing abused or neglected animals which is where the abysmally few lucky ones end up all the cubs in this picture likely have similar health issues iirc for every white tiger roughly thirty others were discarded sold to roadside zoos circuses or straight up killed sold to people practicing traditional medicine and then haven even touched on the white tigers that don have the right proportions who are also discarded it not conservation it exploitation everyone will pay to see white tiger now that you know please choose not to animals in captivity always look so sad hate the fact that the photo captures the two walls they are confined insee thanos halving the living creatures won help am very happy albinosi heard bengal tigers have been pushed out of bengal because of overdevelopment by bengalis they mostly live in south india now can anyone confirm the cubs are the size of her feet she can make them into

get transferred to some reputed one or in wild life sanctuaryomgwhat aryan tiger cubs such qts hope they are taken good care of at the zoo tbh why is she in cagethis zoo looks terrible aah our siddharth garden near bustand happiness noise white tiger is sign of inbreedingnice are they purebred remember reading somewhere that not only white tigers but tigers in general in captivity in were so mixed due to inbreeding and cross breeding from different sub species they could never be eligible to help wild populations white tigers are born out of tiger incest so there that deleted lovelyalbinosthe zoo can offer these cubs to be petted by general public for fee where people can photograph holding these cubs it can be good source of income just look at thailand obviously not right now just when the cubs are big enough removed definitely not higher than retreat problem is the mother would like to feast on the weak ones could be wrong tho but my limited knowledge on animal

modi last week tonight with john oliver hbo www reddit com india comments fnsm modi last week tonight with john oliver hbo in case the youtube link isn working user has provided mirror in the comments np reddit com india comments fnsm modi last week tonight with john oliver hbo fimnd mashable joins the party john oliver deep dive on india prime minister is real eye opener twitter com mashable status the last line really got me india home to this enduring symbol picture of taj mahal of love frankly deserves lot more than this temporary symbol of hate modi pic india deserves much more than this temporary symbol of hate finally something ve been waiting for oh my god the bhakts must be losing their mind m gonna love seeing them cry and moan about this edit he even talked about yogi adityanath and caa protests he actually quite covered lot of it even talked about nehru and gandhi basically telling the whole story in short this is how journalists should treat modi with utter disrespect and suspicion not on twitter have we invaded his twitter profile and called death and rape threats to him and his family the last goddamn line pulled right at my heartstrings loved john oliver before but god would really like to meet him one day he has become one of my main influences in life classic john oliver great wit and sarcasm with excellent background research wondered when he would do piece on india seems like my wish was granted s time to check out the other sub and see chaddis lose their minds nrc kicks anyone who undocumented off the citizenship and the cab lets everyone back on except muslims don think ve seen such simplified expression of what really is happening totally expect swarajyamag to write an article discrediting oliver for some random out of context comment he made and educated bhakts will lap it up that last line brilliance loved it despite being so critical and informative this video still paints rosy picture of india majority of hindus agree with modi divisive agenda so much so that even opposition parties are afraid to take on his hindu nationalism looking at you aap don see modi losing popularity any time soon neither do see any of the democratic institutions doing anything to stop this madness just hope m wrong holy smokes twitter is gonna have meltdown first hassan and now johnny we went from famous to really famousthis is brutal this is essential finally spotlight focused on what happening in india indian media will spin this out of credibility can wait for their mental gymnastics edit that bit about bread the creation of the world is horribly racist holy fucki hope people around the world realize the true nature of hindu nationalists they came to power in promising acche din better days and economic growth now the economic growth has shrunk by half and for the first time in decades the poverty rate has actually increased in india this episode will be the true test of hotstar censorship policy looking forward to watching itmirror link gofile io wkua edit mirror link gofile io qenze the show is produced by hbo and they produce got too let see if the bhakts call for hbo boycott too long time coming this episode was really great he hit all the spots possible in minute format s wow the dislikes on the video are growingoh my god he just spoke the truth all those topics bhakts avoid taking about was pushed back on to the surface really hope bhakts see through his antics and how he is actually pushing the country backwards this was what was expecting from hasan mihaj and got so badly let down oh boi this gonna be fun when bhakts say modi has made indian image goooood m gonna show them this video m pretty sure john will end up making follow up piece to this cuz how bhakts are tolerant about criticismfucking love his british arse waiting for this episode to come on hotstar maybe it won come ending quote because india home of this pointing towards tajmahal picture enduring symbol of love frankly deserve lot more than this temporary symbol of hate pointing towards picture of modi this is fucking amazing wow what show didn wanted to watch the min video but the host just spilled out the harsh truth that no tv channel in india would am totally disgusted by the journalism in india every household that watches news on tv is simply hearing the words of politician through the anchor which is held at gunpoint please god christ ram guru nanak etc save us can wait for patriot act to do more in depth take american here was interested in what was going on with indian politics recently and this came in right on cue vaguely knew that modi was hindu nationalist but didn know what that actually meant in terms of his actions and stuff hasan minaj caved in probably because netflix desperately wants indian business but our guy oliver never compromises that last line though wow modi made it to the show which covered leaders like bolsonaro erdogan xi jinping putin and trump proud moment boys watch the bolsonaro episode if you haven and you ll realise why modiji and he gel so well really enjoyed his take on the issues meanwhile bhakths have arrived to hijack the comment section saying mudi ji was democratically elected lol bjpee was elected on the basis of their jumlas and they are making our nation developed through million ton economy well waiting for years was finally worth it my bhakt friends are mocking jo this is the best piece of journalism have ever seen wished india had journalist like him was just going to post this but reddit showed its already been posted deleted his team did the research and spilling facts american here is this the reasons for the human rights violations in kashmir does this national registry ask people about their religion if so wouldn that information be able to be used against themselves like in the holocaust it just seems like lot of signs of potential genocide love how any journalist can put their opinion on trump in usa hell you can pity ur country and thats the real democracy not like indian pseudo democracythis doesn mean anything of course he is funded by the opposition xb xb xb xb xb xb smust say teared up hearing the last linelets send this to all and get trending on twitter methinks this episode won be on hotstar the day john oliver became anti national wonderful spectacular episode so thankful to john for covering this and so impressed by their deep research on the topic loved it and have shared it all around and wtf is wrong with that grills guy damn aaj maza aayega zee news dekhne maithe video is being brigaided by the bigoted nationalists oof what fantastic summary of the shituation at times in the video felt so ashamed at the state of the country had to look away then remembers the other post in this sub about the self aggrandizing indians regarding indian ceos on on linkedin and now am tempted to post this on there just rewatched ravish on shutupyakunal from almost year ago and sadly it still relevant and depressing as before the anti caa protests seem the only glimmer of hope to rid us of the monstrous bjp ideology jo sums it up best in his outrojohn oliver will be given pakistan visa by bhakts boycott jamie oliver starthe comment section has already been brigaded by people who are defending the great leader despite the fact that the video includes footage of high level ministers read cunts openly spewing racially charged hate comments and people are still defending them by giving out excuses or blaming the last week tonight team for being anti india and it not just the it cell being it cell even people over from the unmentionable sub are straight up ignoring the facts mean don get it m pretty sure john will end up making follow up piece to this cuz how bhakts are tolerant about criticismyess get em john couldn have been happier tonight india home of this enduring symbol of love frankly deserves lot more than this temporary symbol of hate fuck that deep the reason liked this is because the man could say all this aloud without fear which can only think even in democracy never ever share any opinion about with anyone this dude is brave criticizing the most powerful men around the world our country politicians are fucking joke lmaojohn oliver was spot on want to clear up one thing is that there are many indians allied with germany nazi party because they saw germany as an ally against british who were colonizing them many indians did not know about the holocaust and still doesn because of the tyranny of britain rule was so deep nri and us thinks what we thought about modi before elections it not their fault the mofos are aditya bisht stop saying him yogi he isn a yogi see kanahiya latest speech on yt and shivraj singh ki maa ki chut baar and arnab goswami zee news and other sons of bitchesmirror youtu be zfvsnwgrytel laga ke thoka isne lolbest argument against modi giving respect to his good decisions but making sure to roast the shit out of him for his bad onesit was frankly disappointing especially when he spoke about gujurat riots he said modi let that happen and did not do enough to control them modi was the fucking director of that show the video is sadly not available in germany had to access it through vpn temporary symbol of hate the last sentence hit me so hard calling modi the father of india is stupid at best and dangerous at worst xb really couldn have said it any better thought sorting by controversial would be fun but the reactions are pretty mild kinda disappointed am not fan of these infotainment and political satire industry but honestly found john oliver to be better than trevor noah or any other satirist for some reasonthey have used pbs news hour ndtv hindu and bbc as sources too why is there such an outrage about them using al jazeera as one of the sources mods will you pin this this is well researched short summary of modi india just in case new visitors need to see what we face on daily basis ending was pretty inspirational the youtube comment section is already swarming with bhaktsthe last bit brought tears to my eyes temporary symbol of hate my man spot on m surprised that the like to dislike ratio is still so high when first saw that video thought that the comments section is going to be shitstorm but most comments were actually more about the comments section going to be shitstorm than the shitstorm itself guess the it cell doesn know about this guy perfect analysis few minor insignificant pointers cab is now caa should have avoided al jazeera as source should ve mentioned police brutality toothat bit about indians being god baking bread just right was absolutely hilarious fuck he just nailed the last line looks like modi love affair with western media is over for good this timewell it official now india is in shit storm he did earlier episodes on brazil venezuela and now india goodbye guys it was nice knowing you wow just bulls eyemirror www dailymotion com video xslbpmirror www dailymotion com video xslbp deleted original and backup links are now dead m sick of all the concentration camps instead of learning from germany the world is trying to imitate it wtf modi is just like trump an idiot who got into power because of the naive people who believes in him the caa allows any non muslim to enter the state and can be granted citizenship the problem is this st the act is direct violation of the secularism aspect of the constitution nd india is already overpopulated we got higher hunger rates sooo many unemployed soo many eligible qualified persons working in shit jobs for eg software engineer could be working in mall as cashier masters degree holder in biology is working at pet store rd all students union many economists many good and bad politicians are against the act but only modi govt is arrogant and not giving it up th the govt is saying hindus in the other countries are tortured and thats why they want to make the act work but heres the thing that allegation is already proved false even the un is against the caa th modi supporters are anti muslims its like trump supporters being racists and sexists but the problem is these supporters are greater in number so our voices are not getting heard d burn wtf is with the baked bread which kids are falling for that bs in this age its fucked up law many people don have any document here and the problem they face is real just see this random youtuber video in mizoram and the difficulty people face are real youtu be pcbyfofhre min the video is removed already that was fast the only problem have with this video is how it completely overlooked the plight of illegal immigrants muslims or otherwise mean forget about hindu minorities even muslim minorities sectarian are not safe in our neighboring countries and ironically the likes of pakistanis will celebrate this video because john oliver chose not to talk about it waiting for bhakts to call oliver twist anti national and call for boycott of charles dickens that why reddit said link already submitted m jumping in joy truth is going to sting like hell love jon stewart not just for what he did but for encouraging and helping people like colbert oliver samantha bee etc love all these people they validate my belief in positivity can someone make clip of last seconds and link me it would be very helpfull will probably get downvoted but every side is playing politics and this was carefully curated to leave out multiple points and don care about modi or bjp but it about india so here are few most of the videos are from al jazeera and bbc both newspaper who have taken anti india stance multiple times and perpetrated half story depicting india in bad light he gives example of the book talking about indian supremacy pretending as if the whole nation is supporting this notion al jazeera which is funded by the qatar gov considered as propaganda peddler even by its neighbours should not be trusted for any legitimate news source he talked about hindu supremacy where is it apart from some nutjobs giving speeches and there are none at this rate we can also claim there are muslim supremacists like that dude from aimim who gave speeches about crores muslims it was misleading that is my point did al jazeera or bbc mentioned about that too they talked about detention centres okay but why they left out the part of massive amount of immigration from bangladesh edited out some bits that immigrants did cause issues in the north east my friends live there and not just one but one from assam and other from sikkim who told that people from even northern india who go there cause chaos and immigrants have seriously affected the demographics in the border areas seriously hope india discusses this issue for now am linking study that was carried out to show the affects and issues caused by illegal immigrants here the link idsa in system files occasionalpaper nagalandillegalimmigrationl pdf idsa in system files occasionalpaper nagalandillegalimmigrationl pdf so al jazeera and bbc both ignored the issue of immigrants and created their own narration and immigration is an important issue in north east as mentioned we can just give citizenship to the people who came here illigelay so what should be done and nrc was one way we all know the mess it created but there should be some place where illegal immigrants should be places and detention camps were for that why was this part left out even usa have detention camps here the article usa built the world largest detention center in www theguardian com us news sep detained us largest immigrant detention trump www theguardian com us news sep detained us largest immigrant detention trump seriously what choice does india have or any country dealing with immigrants have detention are the temporary solutions now coming to gujarat riots don support modi on that maybe noone should and seriously don know enough about that there were cases which stated that first muslim mob burned the whole train carrying hindus why this is not mentioned but no innocents should have died that day modi is responsible for not containing enough that riot he left out the part where it states that caa was the law for immigrants and people can still apply for citizenship with the usual way it just caa was the faster route for all the religious minorities prosecuted in the places like pakistan afghanistan and bangladesh will add more points later and sources too but wrote this because people in the both sub are either anti or pro but the reality is we need middle ground illigal immigrant is an issue and it needs addressing and till it isn solved other than detention don know what choice we have but don support nationwide nrc but caa and npr should not opposed most of the opposition now am seeing is based on what if not what is and this whole video was very superficial imo have seen videos from both the sides one is saying some shit and other is saying something other shit don like how people here are just brigading because the video confirms their views agree with the most parts but the problem is what they didn show and using al jazeera vice and bbc all of them have taken anti india instance multiple times will link vice videos as proof while bbc which still thinks that india is place of snake charmers really don care about downvotes it just would rather prefer an objective reply but whatever saw thisthe video is blocked in canada best speech in india with turmp remindme hoursi have been waiting for john oliver to do his episode on modi since last march when loksabha election fever started raging he has spoken about brexit before the vote about jair bolosonaro about dueterte putin about poland elections same problem of religious fundamentalism the only time he spoke about modi as he shows in this was his first show which have watched and it portrays modi just like this episode at the beginning with an inspiring story so was hoping that he would aim his wits at the the witless prime and boy he did though what he talked about modi achievements regarding lpg connections and toilets ground realities reported by people seem much different but better people than me should talk about it all of modi achievements are media orgasming themselves over him all pomp and no substance wish oliver had shown how nashah are using media to incite people to hate and do propaganda how it cell is ever churning up poison and injecting directly to people brains via whatsapp but get it too short time to cover everything at least he ended the show perfectly keep getting disheartened over how none of this is going to change thing nrc caa will happen aadhaar will control people most of the media will manufacture toxic fumes like basilisk relatives will continue to be disgusting over whatsapp electoral bonds will keep funneling unprecedented amounts into bikau and jugad party etc etc but when see that ok there re others who re seeing this as do it a relief it like glass of glucon during long exhausting marathon in high summer tells me just one more step just one more day of resistance current people fate may be to get battered and then shattered in the face of mount doom but at least we can be battering rams that can loosen the impenetrable wall so that people after us may have easier time to take it down oh my god holy crap that tale of how races were made is retold in mexi well very mild criticism compared to johnny other reports not even mention of kashmir lock down thank you for bringing this up john oliver matter of kashmir needs to be brought to spotlight like hong kong as welldoes anyone have working mirror why is madam still not untouchable despite being under trial but he is one having come out clean commenting to watch lateranybody else feel like they ve seen india more in the news lately rising economy gold reserve this guy trump visit just me wtf is happening to the links why does no one mention the original sin that was partition and the subsequent treatment of hindu and other minorities in pakistan and bangladesh is it just me or does it seem that all these countries are getting their own version of trump one by one wtf is going on used to think that john gives complete and unbiased opinions on the issues related to west when saw this one as person who lives in india am in doubt if should believe anything that he says he seems to running an agenda showing only one side to the coin side that is convenient to him john oliver drops another semi researched article conveniently ignoring evidence that is contrary to his narrative could ve at least gotten the translation correct anyone who thinks the nehru gandhi duo did the right thing as founders of the nation by partitioning the country is uneducated in india history they were politicians just like the ones we have today plus unprecedented power ,Politics
from swiggy office in kochi www reddit com india comments enzeit from swiggys office in kochi it is punishable didnot know that the laws are good but getting justice is expensive in terms of money and time both xb sad truth of justice systemit is incredibly difficult for women to get justice for workplace harassment my friend was working in it company in bangalore she had sleazy manager it started with verbal assault first commenting about her body in lewd manner not just in office even outside the campus later he started putting her in late night shifts and only she and the manager would be present in the whole floor he would come to her cubicle and will start talking and even touched her inappropriately one day he called her into conference room and closed it and that when she lost it and made formal complaint to the very specific department of hr that handles workplace harassment she and the manager were called in for questioning nothing happens for few days and then she was called in by the hr she was being put in performance improvement plan with chance of being terminated at the end of it if not successfully finished and that too under the same manager she complained she put her papers and luckily found job with in the notice period don endorse the public outing of past sexual assaults in twitter or other social media without any substantial evidence or the lack of intent to legally pursue things all that does is put mark on guy without any proper way to defend himself but lot can be done about workplace harassments it is difficult to prove things at least the company could support the victim by providing her with safe space removing the accused from her chain of reports or transfer to other locations etc only take severe actions like suspension or termination if the accused was found guilty keep the identity of the accused also hidden until the charges are proven so even if it was false accusation he will come out with minimum damage but when women find it extremely difficult to get justice for workplace harassment this poster looks condescending and unsupportive all we ask are neutral laws and proper investigation for every accusation and media to shut the fuck up because innocent until proven guilty no matter what false cases do happen but why is the poster at company workplace it does seem way out of context and honestly bit intimidating especially for say low level employee they probably had an incident or two in their office we can do lot of betterment for men and women both and battle these criminal minds who twist use law for thier benefits only if we overcome from shitty topics such as religion cast nationalism etcah non political post in india subreddit thank you sure ma man this is valid in other countries but here in india the place which has been called the rape capital of the world it such non issue that this type of poster feels almost out of place get your shit together swiggy am not taking side with the perpetrators am just saying that proper laws are there in place to bring those perpetrators to justice but only few false accusations can dilute the perception of general public or employees in corporate setting am strictly only commenting on the photo uploaded here and on the aspect of false accusation in this kind of offence in no way support or demand for lesser punishment for the offenders they should deserve termination and non fit for employability since the quantum of punishment should be this high we also need to safeguard the non offenders and check the the misuse of this law which demands that there should be if not equal then equivalent punishment be served to the false accusers yea but by the time the dust settles and you not convicted of any wrong doing your reputation will have been effected grossly false accusations of sexual assault should have the same punishment as actual counts the punishment for both false accuser or harasser must at least be par to each otherwhat is the context do you want people to be even more scared of reporting harrasment because that is how you get people to be scared of reporting harassment very subtle cant speak for stats in india given that according to official government statistics you are times more likely to be raped in american than india but america for example has to rate of false sexual harassment claims think this whole false reporting thing is blown out of proportion shall explain why this poster is bad by few questions does it mean that when there is no proof of harassment the women will be punished if she complains does it mean when nobody is looking harasser can touch inappropriately and threaten employee that there is no proof and as such she will be punishable if she complainsi get what they re trying to do but this really isn cool it threatening and likely to put people off from reporting cases of sexual assault swiggy looks like terrible place to work in this should be law never knew that but its right you know if you put up just one poster without the others around the office you remove context and completely misrepresent the awareness being spread there are multiple posters of sexual harassment should be reported of the ombudsman for the company what constitutes sexual harassment etcattended posh training in new company it was town hall meeting people trainer was asked how many claims were false it was around regarding punishment it is based on the seriousness of the claim and any damage done in that time it can be warning termination from the job and fine jail term too always creeped out by people who act like false accusations are bigger deal or more common than actual sexual harassment do they also have anti sexual harassment posters up posters encouraging coming forward or is this up just to create chilling atmosphere for reporting actual harassment imagine walking into police station that says false cases of credit card fraud are punishable why the fuck can these moronic companies come up with suitable way to discreetly investigate all complaints they are soo good at hiding their sex offender higher ups anyway this is disgusting only in such society as ours messages like these are encouraged harassment is real sexual harassment against women is real the number of these cases is far far higher than false accusations can believe this is getting upvoted india has legit problem with sexual assault and the answer is to pass legislation to protect men from false accusations the irony is fookin palpablewow never seen one for actual sexual harassment in my life even once it crazy to think how things that mostly affect men are put into light so quickly never have once seen support for sexually harassed victims in any of these tech bro fucking companies goddamit ps this is not about which issue is bigger it about hypocrisy where is the equal size poster that say rape is also punishable grumble those who feel that false accusations deserve no publicity punishment would you be okay with goi line of logic that said that most muslim accused are guilty of terrorism and that only small percentage of muslims are falsely charged with it like how this is tagged as non political also it laughable how swiggy is pretending as if false cases are bigger deal or occur more often then actual cases of workplace harassment the poster is so patronizing wouldn want to work at company that treats it employees like idiots it doesn really work in india actually people don care if you were acquitted if you were blamed that all the society would need to judge you guilty the law exists for your protection not for settling scores wow this post has attracted lot of closet rapists false rape accusations should be punished but not by commiting an actual rape you people sick get mental help the idea that false sexual assault accusations in indian workplaces is more of problem than sexual harassment itself especially towards women is so laughable to me this poster is absurd but it already sitting on top of this subreddit because somehow young men on the internet have convinced themselves that false accusations are more of threat than actual sexual harassment maybe workplaces should consider putting up posters targeting men like don make sexual jokes or comments or don persistently call after hours and see how condescending that is all this poster does is create an environment of intimidation don see what wrong mensrightsmore like if you can prove it don speak outas much as believe that false claimers should be punished this seems wrong there is an excessive amount of women facing sexual harassment whereas false claims are rarity this looks like they want the women who actually experience harassment to remain quiet as these things can be hard to prove already and with punishment hanging on their head they would most likely be silent against everything that happens to them hell with you swiggy what has the world come to accusing delivery guys of sexual harassment because they were slightly latemy friend was in very bitter and toxic relationship but when he tried to breakup his gf filled rape case against him break up after sex before marriage is considered rape and know what things he and his family suffered through he also attempted suicide multiple times the problem in india is that people don think about how men suffer mentally and financially because of such laws when they also have the burden of responsibility to feed their families this biased law is never highlighted by media biased because women can break up but if men do he is rapist any case of false accusation should result in stringest punishment and the woman should be made to pay compensation to the manfalse accusation is real problem but sexual harassment is the biggest problem because it can kill you scar you for life and men who do it always get away with it looks like swiggy is saying that they will give you hard time if you speak against harassment in company space pathetic people edit peopl can read what they ve written over there but understand the psychology women already don come out often and tell about misconduct in working place in fear of losing job now on top of that instead of encouraging women you re saying that think twice before your complain about misconduct because if it proven false we gonna give you hard times it borderline victim blaming and encouraging harassers because we all know how difficult it is to prove sexual harrassment in india keep in mind that false accusations are negligible in number compared to number of misconduct in working place so raising awareness about it is not that important removed rainmaker used to be one of my clients one of the organisations helping with the issue of sexual harrasment in india wait swiggy is in india now swegan man you sure do get around sorry as jojo fan from the us cannot resist hikareru mysterybased afamen courtesy of bunch of passive aggressive incels at swiggy office in kochi things like this remind me of hindu khatre me hai or reverse racism yes false accusations are seriously bad but how often do they happen and historically and even today to certain extent it has been difficult for women to speak up against harassment policies like this might make speaking up difficult and is that cost justified for the benefit that we get from this policy also no law is air tight many people are wrongly convicted in the country not sure about india but in the us people have been wrongly sentenced to capital punishment don see people calling for retaliation against the state for this then why treat sexual harassment differently the fact that some of you are offended that people expect you to not lie about rape tells me everything need to know about you as personhow much money do you wanna bet that the people who had these posters put up have done things that can be construed as sexual misconduct guess this came after the vedio of that swiggy guy good initiativeis this not good thing hear this sexual harassment is against the law and thats much bigger issue no one need to understand that being accused of such heinous crime for an innocent person is highly taxing take note of the humiliation mental agonies there accusation brings to one if they haven committed it the mental scar it will bring is enough for an innocent person to be broken for life and even if they get acquitted they will have trust issues for the rest of their life therefore it is imperative that any false accusers be served the same punishment and no don think the above mentioned to be discouraging for the victim who have enough evidence to support their accusation they need to have faith in their organisational hr department and it is sole responsibility of the management to support the victims and speedy disposal of such cases the management need to established such rapport with all the employees the real question is how to bring to justice offenders where the victims fail to produce enough concrete evidence india of course they are fucked do they seriously care mor about preventing rape allegations than rape someone need to tell them they have problemthey should make it so if someone serves their sentence for rape they didnt commit they should be allowed to rape their accuser sounds crazy at first but think about it it is justice just in different orderi really don like this poster it would be intimidating to those who have genuinely faced sexual harrasment edit do they have any posters that encourage people to come forward and report sexual harrasment such posters can also be used to intimidate and sush people who have genuinely faced such things because lot of sexual harrasment happens behind closed doors some things may be standalone factually true but it is the context that matters we know which problems our society faces and how hard it is for victims of sexual abuse to actually come out and say something with that context this poster is extremely poorly thought out this poster just makes it harder getting people to question themselves before they report anything this poster is simply aimed at reducing workplace complaints and then probably spend from marketing budget to shout we are one of the bestest places to work there is reasons why we don have posters like xb false cases of corruption being reported to vigiliance bureau are punishable by law whistleblowers found to have blown the whistle on false grounds are punishable by law those creating violence can be identified by their clothes itself nice of rainmaker company to have probably brought smile to the face of wilful assaulters abusers and molesters who prey on their colleagues dog whistle is dog whistle is dog whistle disclaimer such laws only exsist in law books are not applied in real life women can get away with murders sodomy and terrorism

detention centre do you think bjp one of the largest party in india now did typo and omitted muslims while adding other how many times did this government really did something secular and democratic intentionally if we don act now we will probably survive for being hindu or non islamic but not long before we loose our friends social fabric and turn into hindu version of afghanistan pakistan it so unfortunate that we don consider bhutan model where the king is extremely progressive our laws since are mostly executive execute orders with shortsightedness everything is one man show with world

brave pakistani soldiers are in control all borders must be opened and all refugees be given immediate citizenship we must immediately set up birth quota of children for muslim couples and only allow child to hindu couples in addition we will provide financial incentives for islamic conversion jaihindis he indirectly saying that people of other religions are chutiya ,Politics
muslim neighbors came lifted the bier also chanted ram naam satya hai in the funeral procession of hindu man because of the covid fear none of his relatives came to lift the bier www reddit com india comments frw muslim neighbors came lifted the bier also this is india not what they keep blaring at news channels all the time not what those polititians keep talking about for their purposes this is the india grew up in and this is the india mahatma gandhi dreamed of and died for ravi shankar son sent messages to relatives friends and the father death in the neighbourhood but none arrived due to the lockdown the death of ravi shankar further aggravated the unhappy family there was no one to shoulder the bier and to carry the corpse to the crematorium seeing the plight of the son the muslims prepared the brief and assisted the body to be taken to crematorium where the home man ravi shankar can rest in peace xb source zainab sikander twitter com zainabsikander status working with the print navbharat times navbharattimes indiatimes com state uttar pradesh bulandshahr no relatives reached after death of hindu muslims join last ride cremate body articleshow cms hindi newspaper article newsd in coronavirus lockdown muslims assist funeral procession of hindu deceased well well there may be some humanity left in this countryishwar allah tere naam may have some context to this not personal context religious context was taught that in islam lifting the bier kaandha dena is considered very spiritual and respectful act so much so that in some burials and janazahs you can find literal strangers scrambling to carry the bier of any passing by muslim body even for just couple of seconds remember my mother insisting on me to support the bier of any death ritual we go to you ll also notice in the video how people are rushing to carry the bier and how folks keep circulating their positions by giving everyone chance haven verified this news but m assuming some mulsims couldn bear the disrespect of nobody giving shoulder to their dead neighbour which is why they may have done this this should be brought to attention of main media channels and shown on tv such welcome video except the man dying part in these days of doom and gloom the media will never show this don be surprised guys if someone manipulated the video and share it on whatsapp with caption muslim mob throwing hindu man due to corona fear humansbeingbrosindia for you m all for this but wtf happened to social distancing there is reason that others did not come out dead body can still spread virus right mera india removed it is not something that should be appreciated infact think it was pretty foolish move there was reason why his bier was not lifted by his relatives at this moment where we have thousands of cases coming up everyday it seems like the best move although it sounds harsh don understand how people are not understanding the importance of social distancing in the event of actual covid deaths it should be handled by government burial done by people with protective equipment and lime love every bit of thisthe same thing was discussing with my wife the other day in uk unconfirmed reports say that the gov is deciding on mass cremation irrespective of religious rights to burial or cremation apparently in italy they are doing mass cremations as people are not readily available to carry out these duties reminded her that for muslims it the religious duty to partake in funerals and they would do that if they were allowed in the lockdown it may well be the same people they harbour extreme hate against end up performing their last rites it sad to see someone so dear die during this pandemic irrespective of whether the person died of corona or not great gesture by the neighbours by respecting humanity over religion now this may come off as rude and extremely insensitive but the relatives not coming to lift the bier is just following the lockdown protocol at this stage of the pandemic you don want more people to contract covid or worse succumb to it countries have started to ban funerals don know if india is one of them but highly think that they should be banned here in india too don know the solution to this sensitive issue but cremation of the dead preferably as per their religious beliefs should be added in the essential services it probably is part of it but with the facility of taking away the body from the house hospital so that it avoids crowds like these at funeral the traditions like kandhaa dena bring lot of risk of people coming into groups and should be banned the tradition that the cremation service could follow is cremating them as per their religious beliefs with least possible or perhaps even no family members know this sounds very very insensitive but think looking at the gravity of the situation such severe protocol implementations are needed maybe this service could act as an employment opportunity for some people who aren been provided with relief funds amidst this crisis too if am not wrong the bodies of the patients who died to covid aren being returned to the family as well which again sounds insensitive but is necessary majority of muslims non sanghi hindus be kind and just to everyone we re in this together rss hitler did stellar job cleaning up the minority mess to keep germany ethnic purity we leetle beet inspired aap ideology samajhiye point to me single modi supporter sanghi who would display even hundredth of the humanity shown by these people towards muslim family if the situations were reversed the rss infested hindu majoritarian society of today is blot on humanity sanghis m gonna pretend didn see that feeling paraud indian army jang me maidan me kade na harteone more jihad will this religion stop destroying our sacred hindu religion this is probably goodness jihad these are those brothers of ours who are born on indian soil and very proud of them funerals in this environment are really saddening ve heard of cases where sons and daughters couldn come for last rites in muslims the body requires ritual cleaning and namaz is prayed with generally lot of people congregated before the procession now none of this is possible or it is done with minimum people who might not be related to the deceased dunno much about other religions last rites but it probably terrible that own blood can come for them vredditdownloaderi lost hope in humanity and then see this this is beautiful inter religious solidarity praxis the stuff secularist egalitarian dreams of source rest of reddit indiaverse in shambles appreciate that this happened and people of different religiosity came out and helped but still feel that they should have practiced physical distancing and used some protection god blessing to our friends from each community caste religion and tribe who are keeping humanity alive godspeed india great show of religous tolerance in such communally charged times but maybe it would have been safer if they didn especially with all this corona going hope everybody is safethis may be good deed although why are so many people going to burn single body during times like these incredible india awesome know it all very touching and all but is no one gonna say that their are reasons no one was holding that they all are ediots all hospitals should be getting the dead cremated burnt in small controlled system rest countries are doing so wonder why are we always behind and someone know thinks its the muslims that brought covid because they keep traveling to arab countries can be more ashamed that know these people muslim neighbors came lifted the bier also chanted ram naam satya hai just curious about this isn this islamically haraam any muslims here who can talk about this thanks nobody is going to put this in their status or share it in whatsapp groups this is the real india that we are in we are secular not just by constitution but by blood also suddenly amit shah comes out of his rabbit hole am gonna end this community unityplease upvote the fk out of this my country my muslim brothers and m proud hindu brahmin naah but madhur won ever show you this you know why because hindus khatre me hai bois trust me us hindus have real danger from from like himmodi and bjp is trying to destroy this communal love among the communities this is why love india this is india remember the mission our country was founded on country where the priorities of all us will be the priority of the state irrespective of our religion if we see the news or whatsapp we will not see this people need to stop challenging this mission be it media be it the bjp that real india and real indians we are not what our politicians pictures us humanity still existssalute this is the india love social distancingthis gives me hope wholesome happy to see this post in the current indianiceu vredditdownloadernow they all should get tested for corona vredditdownloaderv redditdownloader what does ram naam satya hai mean where is this exactly its so cool but it really is bad cause covid but its also so cool waahlife can be so much more than one religion deleted this real reflection of an economic class of india that the right wing fascists fail to see and dream to destroy while the neo leftwingers often innocently make fun of for bad grammar and backward cultural beliefsthis is the content am here for ajj dil se awaz nikal rahi hai mera bharat mahan quality crossoverfeelsgoodmanwhere is the freakin media covering it people show humanity when they are all in trouble this is nature this is real humanity am missing something here covid isn just some hashtag it a completely legitimate reason to be afraid and cautious the virus is exactly why people shouldn be gathering in large groups like these guys are how is this admirable feel like m in the fucking twilight zone with these inane comments taking common sense measures to limit the spread of deadly disease outweighs solidarity or whatever the hell this blunder is supposed to conveysome d in sub will defy that its all fake on your face amit shah what is corona when we have fought this sanghis govt kudos to the guys truly inspirational the news will never show stuff like this because they don want people to believe that good exists in this world amit shah has left the chat only happen in india moronsthese type of news should be viral on one hand social distancing is important and on the other hand mourning the death of loved one isn easy so it good to have help and also fall back on rituals don see big crowd so it isn that bad damn muslim people are the best vredditdownloader deleted india at it best want to live in this india not modi india now if only the old bigots of whatsapp could see what india truly is this is india true spirit outwardly expressed this is goldsauce great act of humanity and kindness but if family people are not coming to assist it is probably to maintain social distancing if and when cases pile up it would be detrimental to the whole lockdown effort if people keep breaking the norms nevertheless this gesture deserves to be highlighted in the positive light of unitary compassion that it is supposed to be taken as rss and bjp hates this vredditdownloaderwhere is this video from it is humanity positive imagery is so powerful this needs to be in our peripheral when the devisive forces make their next move corona positive humanity revokenedwould it still have been wholesome if they didnt chant ram naam satya hai because now if someone says that it goes against main principle of islamic monotheism they ll be branded bigot and radical mullah this is the kind of stuff like to see in this subredditi love the humanity irrespective of religion here but isn this threat to public health during lockdown this is the humanity that needs to be preserved leftist way to make things complicated in this situation please don not go on any funeral don touch anything if you are doing this you are bringing corona to home you will be infected and your entire family will also no hard feelings appreciate the gesture but you have to admit they are very very suicidal suicide bombers too mean corona will kill them first and others too yeh hai hindustan bharatpoor muslims being stockholm syndrome that they have to prove their nationalism and commitment to communal harmony by chanting and engaging in acts that may not be appropriate for their own religious beliefs have no problem with this video but in the present climate would you see the opposite fucking nincompoop their relatives couldn come due to lockdown this is very rare but stupidonly true for funny video in reality no deleted most hindus are scared of jadu tona more than this covid somw people just ask for pandemic don they good to see they still remember their rituals ok it was just to piss some people off highly appreciate the effort of our fellow muslim brothers thank you ya this is very good and fucking stupid in these dire time bodies must go to crimination centers the close family should reach there and press the button no need to act stupid hero do understand the good gesture and it is very nice but if you are doing good deed then let it be upar wala dekhega what is the purpose of recording the shamshan yatra and then spreading it in news and twitter stinky ,NonPolitical
this type of cringe on linkedin is really getting out of hand www reddit com india comments eyydy this type of cringe on linkedin is really getting apparently none of them are indians but us citizens ask the people posting this how many of these companies are indian deleted reliance ceo is an indian so who is running india mukesh bhai someone please tell him all of them are us citizenssome were ex indians some were never indians none of them are indians deleted and they don even live in india if the other nation did the same with them like our government is doing then they would ve achieved nothing you should be respectful towards other countries that are giving chance to those who are talented irrespective of their religion and nationality indians are completely brainwashed this simply shows their arrogant behaviour linkedin is pretty bad in content recommendation it like facebook for working people too many people who are looking for gratification m glad to see people like you guys m sick of indians taking pride in the imaginary indian race am so sick indians have done this indians have done no dude all see indians doing is commenting in hindi under youtube videos with roman letters people that are ceos or owners of these companies mostly don have indian nationality there parents might be indian but they grew up in the american or whatever society not the indian society their skin color doesn suddenly make them smart their society does and their society is western not indian am not saying that people grown in the indian society can be smart there are many indian grown smart people but think we all get the point here edit wanted to add that don understand why these guys are happy to see the world being controlled by corporations that not something to be proud of send this as whatsapp forward saying what congress achieved in years so who running the world illuminatino offense but isn that something that we should be ashamed of it just means that india can provide an environment to attract talent and top companies at home that indians go out and succeed isn something to be celebrated it a tragedy they are indian or indian origin bcos of their cultural leaning that considers the pursuit of wealth to be the highest ideal if you do not subscribe to this ideology you will fall by the wayside in pursuit of career greatness in the last weeks ve heard variations of this from very high placed indian executives at an lse traded firm located in the middle east their career advice can be summed up as below your boss is your god he is always right your boss wife is also your god albeit of lesser nature if you re worth ask for and eventually be happy to settle for if you re been asked to work for hrs day work hrs day and always come in mins before treat people below you as dispensable assets and see them as sub human at all times keep them in their place other cultures probably have different understanding of work life balance and hence are not prime candidates for wilful modern slavery to the system and god help you if you re indian and don believe in the bs above world is run by people who gtfo from this country this and the idiotic emails that linkedin keeps sending when you ve no worthwhile achievements to be proud of you take pride in infantile things like race caste religion language wealth of parents or more importantly nation you also take pride in other people achievements as if they were your own to compensate for your own inferiority indians are doing good job everywhere except india guess who is at fault here indians lmaoo indian have to move out of their country to be successful how bout dattindia has vast human resource but due to this fucked up system talents are being drained to abroad which offer better opportunities gotta learn it from the chinese how they manage to keep their talentsthis type of pseudo love for country is the reason today we re under the government of bjpjust wait for reddit to get indianized like quora then we ll be in true hellyeah lol imagine being proud just because someone had to run away from your country to achieve success proud of sharing the same dna type xb someone once said that indians are the proudest people about the least things none of them are founders they are picked up so the founder can eat and sleep and party for the rest of their lives is chest thumping something that runs in our blood the real question is why they left indiahow is this not an uncle message from whatsapp the world is companiesthe more hindutva fails to deliver the more these morons have to resort to delusion wait adobe ceo is indian man fuck you this reminds me of that skit on goodness gracious me there ll be one uncle who will convince the audience that everyone is indianwe indians really ruin every social media facebook quora and now linkedin there is nothing more that speaks worse of india as country than posts like these if indians are so good then why the hell are they not ceos of such huge companies of indian origin because they are very few and far between india is country that can provide for its talents so they go elsewhere to realise their potential slap this on their face www firstpost com india tejasvi surya lauding arvind krishnas ibm appointment as his own begs the question why isnt india launchpad for global leadership htmlthey all have american passports earn in dollars and spend that money in the usa they have no net benefit to india except for false pride factor agli baar aisa whatsapp forward aye block karo chutiye koand who is running india anpadh gawarianwinning by proxylinkedin is worse than facebook the sheer amount of humblebrag posts and self appointed industry leaders is funny to read some random obvious shit like people don leave companies they leave toxic cultures gets thousands of views they are employees and not the founders say this when some people brag about india if indians are running the world then why is our economy in bad shape they are ceo cuz they earned it what about you love how most people don understand how difficult it is as ceo to make major decision without the approval of the board and then shareholders whoever wrote that is hella high on desh bhaktism this is nothing to be proud of it is rather shameful that we dont have an ecosystem or decent standard of living for such talented people to consider working here and transforming the nation this is something very sad and something we should mourn over instead of being proud of it speaks of the volume of brain drainage happening in india it even more scary when you think about how many talents are being suppressed just because they can not find the opportunities here and neither are wealthy enough to migrate to some other country and prove their worth next level coming soon with all of them are hindus maybe because we do the same work for less money ツ the real question want to know is how many nobel prize have we won in topics other than economics considering the general population is mostly made out of engineers doctors other science fields profiles on linkedin these days mai mere ko sab aata hai mai expert hu like one does hello world program and writes an essay on it in the caption used ai ml and because smart indians get out of the country apparently all of them are non prosecuted immigrants they achieved these coz they fucked off from the country going by this logic he saying the whole world is controlled by companies won be surprised if this is bhakt replied to one of the comments but wanted to include this in the main thread as well as child of indian immigrants in canada not us our experience is distinctly different from other canadians although am proudly canadian am also proud of my indian heritage there is difference between us and others and there is shared set of cultural norms stories customs etc that people of the indian subcontinent have so m sick of people dismissing indian americans as having no cultural tie to being indian gtfoh with that bullshit we still love our heritage even if we don love the government or have any ties to indian politics oh wow worshipping the rich who exploit us is so fun if they are indians exploiting us indian pioyes indians are excellent managers excellent at managing foreign company fortune top quality bullshit majority shareholders of all those companies are indians how many of them have voted for modiji hahaha have found that in recent times linkedin has gone down the same path as quora facebook etc thank you jio this is old add ibm to the list yeah but the wonders aren indians pepsi ceo was indian cherry picking wrong corporations and billionaires are running this world don know who is running the world maybe it is the collective effort by all but one thing know for sure that this guy single digit iq is not doing shit for the world imagine taking pride in brain drain youtu be hjwdackuindian americans are force to be reckoned with here in america they re involved with just about any industry usually in leadership position it ll be interesting to see if the ethnic group becomes more involved in politics here in the states slaves priding themselves on picking the best cottona bunch of random companies the world fuck that noise linkedin is the tiktok of the business worldamerica all these companies founded by non indians in america indian people sounds neutral to everyone they are free any biasness so they choose indians as bait but that is totally opposite of what going on india india loves white people whether it be donald trump indian born out of people in the world are indianthose are india why because bjp not ruling that time but they are no longer indian except there name my father one of these people there usually one way to silence them ask them who are the owners of these companies it like being happy that stocks markets are at all time high even though your stocks have shit the bed ask these insecure fucks why there not one alibaba oneplus vivo oppo huawei tiktok lenovo etc from india yetlol what joke have you ever been to india we can run our own country and you think we are running the world lmao they day indian stop leaving their own homeland to escape poverty ll start listening then until then chup karo bhenchod apni sambhali jati nahi doosro ki sambhal ne aatay ho dont know why people didn find this motivational that these guys with all the hardships and being immigrants in another country reached the top level it doest matter they are us national now or indian citizens its our lot that reached the top in their fieldlet them live in their bubble reality indian people in india cannot achieve this success because they are not provided with the right resources in this country they have to leave this country with the knowledge skills and experience they gained in their early years then they go abroad and work hard to achieve this kind of position that boomer as fuckwhat worse these arrogant pseudo patriots kids are the future of our glorious country the world will be better place if people stop taking pride in the things that they don achieve few years ago coworker from india was happy to tell me that my race caucasian blond female is going to be rare because the india population is much larger and expanding now think he right if you ve been to any engineering school especially graduate programs it almost all kids from india wanting job in the us as soon as possible the schools are literally sucking and spitting them out to get as much money as they can out of them it a win win ve heard similar stories in other grad students in stem there are very few americans in stem programs now don understand why people are cringing this is great that people of indian origin are thriving and prospering in the s there used to be glass ceiling and then this is one more reason to gloat over pakistan people who are criticizing that they are not india citizens or these companies are not indian get your emotion and had that kind of thinking for long and truly believe that having big companies come out of india is important and that too being having majority stake by indians only look at how china stands now in terms of big companies but again understand that the world is now global wherever the company maybe registered the people actually holding the value of company can be from different places secondly it does matters lot when having peole of indian origin as cxo of these big companies because every company is setting up their operations and business globally hence these people have an influence on whether to open centre in china brazil or india no matter how much people condemn companies like amazon for disrupting india market but at the end they are creating jobs pouring money into our system hence they are contributing to our economy again as said would love to have indian companies producing products for india as well as for the world but for that we need money to invest and grow and right now huge chunk of that comes from outside only as we don have that level of internal consumption we are low per capita gdp country lastly don undermine the effort these people and other indians working abroad have put in to reach the position they are at today it takes time effort emotional sacrifice to go and live in another country and make place for yourself among the majority white population also keep in mind the remittance money india recieves because of these people on positive note indian startup ecosystem is picking pace and doing well and as the economy will grow the startups will grow as well what are some of the top comments to that post is tak to thik tha bande ne was bhi daal diya and how many of these are indian companies where do all of these people live not in india hyping up everything when asked what are you doing with your life no answer consolation prize if indians had one dr indianpeoplelinkedinif blacks are african american then are they indian americanthe owners are not indiansfeels like the early s againthis doesn matter even though they re indian they ve done pretty much nothing for india and they re not at fault even if they decide let make contribution to my country even before he lands his contribution will be gobbled up by some political party stating that it was their idea still not bad right maybe that person doesn care about name he does everything he could like plans to bring corporation work to india to generate employment or plan to build certain expensive tech which people might use nope not gonna happen plans of building new corporate building where there are trees opposition party will come and sit on dharna plans to build an expensive tech which takes time project has started taxpayers money already spent opposition party comes in power and decides to shut down the project even though it already half done people should deserve credit for doing something but most of the time party showcases it as if their idea later if opposition comes in they shut down the existing project instead of completing it and their own similar project indian political environment is trash right now all major parties bjp congress aap shiv sena etc etc doing the same thing meanwhile taxpayers are getting fucked hope our future is better and that politicians might give younger and more educated people chance but that too not gonna happen guessthey are persons of indian origin not indians surrendered their citizenship at the first chance the got this is really cringy af all are employees that can be fired they are not owners fall of them packed their bags and jumped ship very indian but not indians yeah keep fucking thumping your chest while shouting indiaaan rules the fuck have you done the fuck did you do as an individual be proud of that shit because those guys will always have someone who proud of them but only you can be proud of yourself at every step of your life americans as they are employing indians to be the ceos of these companiesisn this to be expected well we have the largest population so it is going to do something or the other being ceo is just one of those things we shouldn be that surprised population ke hiaab se har me se ek aadmi indian hai pr kya har me se ek bari company ka ceo

indian youtu be gc qyknris united states really running the world don get it mean it can compel smaller countries enough to be considered as running the world but can united states compel other countries like russia and china know united states did compel japan by forcing the plaza accord and knocking down the economic growth japan enjoyed until the s am just having difficult time believing that united states can really overwhelmed countries like china and russia to toe the line anymore mean it does seem like united states still has the upper hand but don understand how united states is till able to get its way without trading something off to countries like china and russia where is this united states dominance is fueled from militarily it can intimidate nuclear powers like china and russia economically united states can overwhelm china anymore so where is this perceived power of united states still generating from that is considered to be able to make every other country on earth toe the line it almost as if it a really populous country in global economy also even superman is indian youtu be gc qyknrindians are not running the world this is moronic if indians were running the world these companies would be made by indians but they are not this is not the things we should looking from progress perspective the real question we should be asking is how many companies that are successful are made by indiansquestion so who running the world answer the boards of these companies are running the worldall it does is provides more information and clarity on these types of company and diversity they promote now how many indian companies we have that have foreign nationals as ceos more specifically whites am talking about infosys tcs wipro etc wow this shit is still thing only big companies in the whole world huh quackibm to be ceo is an indianindians who run the world tell me again where the profits goand none of them doing any real good for india what the big dealgirlsr sadcringeinstead it should be india lost talented being to west and what proud to be indian in it they re american meanwhile there are millions of indians sending remittance of billions of dollars back to their country but are getting abused and living in pathetic conditions abroad no one seems to care about themthey became ceos because they escaped from india if they were in india they may be still thinking about there caste and religion and how to hate others they are americans not indians just goes to show how america is ruling the worldindian americans द ख ह स र द न

those are the real players in the business industry this is not to belittle indians but to be realistic about the scenario this is just to cloud the real people behind the wheel looking at the comments must be the only one who likes this post sure these people are the ones who left india or maybe they are second generation indians but it still great these instances change the world perception of us from slumdog millionaire to savvy and competetent individuals who re just as good as them they are some postive inspiration stories for us to look up to some more practical advantages knowing that so many professors in every foreign university are indian it makes it much easier for us to get foreign reasearch internship same goes for applying to foreign companies who have significant indian diaspora foreign companies become lot more willing to invest in india when they stop seeing it as shithole indians are not ruling the world but that is no reason to not take it positively nonetheless these days feel like india has become very negative and critical maybe it the present political climate but hope it temporary this www firstpost com india tejasvi surya lauding arvind krishnas ibm appointment as his own begs the question why isnt india launchpad for global leadership htmlpeople need to realize this half of these people aren even residents of india and this isn patriotic or anything yeah sure they re indians but they excelled after leaving india india is full of problems our government our economy our bigotry rape murder etc we need to start caring raising awareness for this shit instead so many people don give shit about politics because they re privileged and we need to remind them to start caring lack of knowledge is ruling the worldxsooo india is running the world ceo is temporary position founder is permanantindian in this list means by ethnicity not nationality this is an age of globalization people move to other places in search for better opportunity or academic purposes stop abusing people who work hard and have made name for themselves if they work in other places it doesn mean they have lost there heritage and culture indians are the biggest remittance receivers in the world so before abusing them as non indians they do more for the indian economy then some random loser on the internet lmao so many indian ethnic people reaching top ceo position shows the brightest of india are capable of being the best in the world at what they do stop being hating bitch reminds me of the old uk comedy series goodness gracious me www youtube com watch hjwdacku www youtube com watch hjwdacku ceo is just an employee the share golders are the ones who rule woh lo linkedin pe copy kiya woh chutiya bhi indianreally the ceo of nokia is somehow involved in world domination conspiracy the ceo of teds burger shack is indian that it they re running the world if you asked beyonce she would tell you indian girls to be exactthese kinds of people are insecure about our country and thus try to prove that we are better than others meanwhile knowing where we actually standa nation of billion people where tech tech computer science mba is the prominent academic trajectory produces loads of ceos for tech companies who have thunk fthey are of indian origin but are now foreign residents we have enough other good examples as if these supposedly indian are going to send money to the op of linkeden an ceo being indian origin or even indian how does it benefit you op seeking validation somewhere they carry

ceo because they are indians the day they say it they will lose their job and most have american citizenship ah yes taking pride in other peoples achievement to compensate your own with the only common link being the same race and artificial political borders tbf most of the white ceos of successful companies before that were usually not more than generation immigrants too there is push to succeed in new immigrant families irrespective of race based on the immigration patterns from the last years we ll see more asians and indians doing better the years before that the immigrants were mostly white immigrants from europe so we essentially see the same trends repeat you don see random european countries being proud of their former citizens don see why india needs to do the same fthis is everyone pretends to like usi am an indian and my question to this idiot is what the heck did you do to make others proud wow til all these desi ceos guess it a pass down from the colonial east

 in response to modi unfortunate comment on the clothes identifying the group of those protesting against cab nrc and npr protestor takes off his shirt to show his janeu now what do you have to say about that prime minister mohan guruswamy www reddit com india comments ebcxmp in response to modis unfortunate comment on the link to the tweet twitter com advaidism status sab nanga sipowerful image but it won affect the govt they are just waiting for people tk get tired and stop now they ll call him an impostor ye gormint kisi ki sagi nahi hai you are fool if you think they are with hindus they use hindus religious sentiments and keep fooling them to stay in power agar bjp ki vote bank by chance muslim ho jaye to phir dekhna hindus ko danda karega just anything for the power but this is very powerful image because the nation would see this and once the hindus get against this govt it would be just bunch of powerless individuals in the govt what mad lad nice job more power to the brahmbro its time academics replace politicians are you not entertained am hindu brahmin and am against cabab ki baar modi sarkaar really what for think about it some of the images from these protests are going to be iconic they ll go down in history aaj muslims ko desh se nikalenge kal jab muslims nehi rahenge toh christians fir jains jab sirf hindu rahenge toh lower caste ko nikalenge organizations like bjp can only thrive when they have an enemy to fight against if their is no enemy left they will create one from their own organisation holy shit that some straight up heroism today was at mumbai university protest and hats off to the mumbai police it went totally peacefullyi was once arguing with bunch of bhakts on quora at once have an easily identifiable brahmin surname so at the end of the argument when they had nothing of note to say they just started calling me an impostor and muslim using fake name on quora none of them were brahmin as well come at me bitch big dick energy one man spreads his wings as the battle beginshow shameless our pm has to be to say such outrageous things on the campaign trail but then act dignified and nice otherwise remember when he accused manmohan singh and other congress leaders of treason that was the lowest of low this fucker can do anything to win damnnn son such big fuck you to modi india needs this type of crazy only then they can understand just want to tell everybody who voted for bjp in the past that you re late but better late than never this is gonna be india tiananmen square not as upscale as the original but just as powerful of picture woah man goosebumps where is this if it is from assam then it is not big issue protest at assam has been native vs illegal migrant both hindu and muslim are participating and majority protesters are from hindu if we can see such participants from hindu people in other parts of the country specially north india then only we can say govt is worried so far everything is going as per plan the more is the rioting by muslim better it is for govt and more happy the sanghis would be all concerns about economy will be glossed over modi show em ur tittiespowerful picbaggi thi ghode laga diye desh ke pardon an american but what is janeu as muslim who has seen several close friends turn into bhakts over the past few years just want to thank this guy big fucking thank you understand this subreddit doesn necessarily represent the aam janta but its comforting to see that there are those who will still fight for the idea of india there is still hope this warms my fucking heart द ध न ल म म त र प य ल म बल त क र ac म प ड़ त थ न म अनपढ़ स सद म श कच त म द र म त क य घ ट व क स ह ग motabhai ne rahul ki janeu ko nahi maana toh yeh mahashay kaun hain what courage these gonna be made in politicsthis has the potential to be india tank man imagetat guy now unlimited powerghodi minions would come up with shits like true brahmin would never go against hindu dharma and hindutva they would support cab as it saves hindus your identity doesn matter for those people if you are against them they will find way to destroy your identity and oppress you to all those who are saying bjp is doing this only for votes every political party does things for political goals but bjp has followed its ideology to core they followed they had two seats and they are following it now when they have sometimes its about ideology right or wrong they are only doing what they promised and what they always stood for plus if can sense why there is such unrest in the muslim community even when its not against indian muslims you have turned blind eye to the larger plan koi modi ka bhakth moujood hai yaha oh acha bina dimag wale reddit use nai krte nathe protest for cab nrc have different connotations at different areas around india the fact that it is so scattered and unorganised in national sense is making the job of the government to handle it so easy opposition is also trying to capitalize on regional distress but mostly at regional levels unifying the protest on national scale and providing unified agenda would have bigger impact on challenging the newly ratified amendments believe it wrong to question whether cab or not because believe such measures were already there in the ruling partys manifesto so since people have voted knowingly one should have seen it coming the need of the hour is to challenge the intricate unconstitutional methods as stated by most who opposed rather than diss the bill altogether indian rambo am loving this www newindianexpress com nation dec spontaneous stir plunges assam into chaos html lmao the protester went back in time to do this this is powerful image yeh mera gaanv hai aur main yahaan ka jaykant shikrewhy why people vote bjpvery powerful messageso help me understand how did bjp come to power with such majority does the majority of indians actually support the hindutva ideology it must include some middle and upper class folks too otherwise how did bjp win kuch bhi karlo hum hindu musalmaan se aage bad hi nhi pate aise toh yeh never ending hi rahega dono hi kehte ek dusre ko fascist terrorist kya fayda society ko aur divide karke from neutral perspective if try to think there have been some of the ironies during the protest police which was created to protect the citizens is attacking them brutally institutions and people who very proudly call themselves voice of secular practice marginalizationpro gamer movewhy is there so much coverage about the protests but not enough to spread the reason behind the protests so that more people can join it amazing how the nation seems to be divided into exactly two opposite sides when there could be many different ones to the situation edit grammarbeing dalit have reserved response to the janeu but this is simply awesome it shows that symbols are polyvocal and can evoke plethora of meanings defeat fascismi really sorry but m out of the loop on the whole issue can anyone give gistwhat is janeu how can right minded people support illegal immigration to immigrate to another country there needs to be good reason on top of that india is already one of the most populous countries in the world look at the water shortage prices of vegetables cost of land how can india afford more illegal immigrants secularism is fashion for few and trp rating for few others brave and wise man this can become iconic respect oh this is going to be an iconic image explanation for people that don know aka me does anyone think this looks similar to the pink guy and bane image looks like india answer to that tank man from tianammen squareiconicoh you re approaching me unfortunate comment hey everyone don want to say anything that would offend anyone

identify thru their clothes was populist remark made for masses to solidify that us vs them mentality by the time we realise that how gruesome it is to hear such comments from the head of the state of the world largest democracy that remark would already have worked its effect hope for the opposite and if it has we shall see rise in nation wide opinions in the favour of nrc cab implement plus rise in protest against it which in turn would again solidify ruling party arguments he intends to start vicious cycle with that remark which wud only benefit him anyway but possible way out in my opinion is exhibition of extreme gandhigiri from the protestors delhi temperature if someone can please explain why the protests have taken to delhi not being in india is kind of weakening the contextual knowledge have of this situation its all bbc articles rn thankswhat did modi say about clothes the bill is about giving proscecuted christians hindus and sikhs refuge and shelter in india why are people protesting what did modi say can someone explain this to me there seems to be protest in every country latelyhe doesn exerciseghar ka bhedi lanka dhaye what is cab because as far as know about it it about giving citizenships to certain refugees also nrc sounds like social security system in usa which no hindus or muslims oppose watch lots of indian news and there is no mention of concentration camps so where is this rumor coming from using symbol of oppression to fight oppression nice recall ajmal kasab wore kalewa religious thread on his wrist just stop let recap don hijack

only in india would this be proudly advertised www reddit com india comments dukxw only in india would this be proudly advertised did you forget this gem kinja img com gawker media image upload kvuybt c fill fl progressive g center h q w jpg guys is there is company which specialised in helping me lose the virginity preferable in hyderabad ddiscrete consultation as opposed to continuous consultation pwhat kind of stuff you watch that facebook recommended you thisif only we had the semblance to get our set of priorities rightcall me when they make devirginization process this is definitely not an only in india thing no downtime so the bride can go nuts during the bachelorette on friday get fixed up on saturday and become the demure virgin bride on sunday so convenient removed next step would be wiping your memory of the act altogether total recall virginity version lotta unpacking here can doctors also undick the lass while they re rebuilding the hymen yay let start off married life with lie nothing can go wrong there liberated enough to choose dick not liberated enough to choose husband that not how virginity works someone finaally discovered an untapped market virginity is sacred in catholic countries toot needs to see this also guys don downvote because you dont agree with it some unkill will say yeh toh kuch bhi nahi in avar mahabharata draupadi had been given the boon of becoming virgin before entering the room tent of another husband high men prefer intact hymen lol what does no downtime mean had no idea women were computers no downtime lmao whatalso in china it common over therethis makes me wonder there is person who daily job is to create posters like this and post them on social media if you lose your virginity and get it back through surgery isn it cheating on the basis of misrepresentation of facts logically but guy who wants only virgin girls is shit head and he probably deserves girls with shitty mentality like that they would be perfect couples what the actual fuck indian pussy is very big deal for conservative indians but am wondering what would make girl willing enough to go for this and new gem has been added to shitty ads wonder if any female would actually go there not an only indian thing this shit is very popular present in the western world too it seems that it is popular in south korea also www youtube com watch gqfwbcpxhjq www youtube com watch gqfwbcpxhjq don care about it being discrete what matters is that it is discreet so fucking messed up intact hymen or no hymen doesn mean virginitygenerally the links in the comments do not get upvoted or viewed but please see this one beg youtu be fbqnqtkhsqfunny thing is an intact hymen is not absolute sign of virginity there are many of way one can rupture the tissue horse riding bike riding etcu moojo let stop playing the devil advocate and pushing the thread in different direction please just want to say this stigma is present in many more parts of the world sadly guess it is often more prevalent in conservative demographics us and canada have these procedures for married women remarried women who wish to gift their spouses virginity while it probably shouldn exist anywhere to start with it nothing unique to india of course there no real debate it all depends on how modiji feels about the whole thing paging ti reminder that virginity is nothing more than meaningless social construct and means absolutely nothing biologically only virgins think sex with virgins is good thing sex with virgins sucks oh god why disappointed that horizontal line missed the spot disgusting this won work on me hmmmmmm interestingshare more of these misogynist pics from india lets see how far we can go with such advertisementlmao they gon give

many christian nations and especially in southern america not to say that this isn a problem but not problem in india alone targeted ads is op hiding somethingfucking patriarchs no downtime so basically they are repairing machine that can immediately start working after the procedure is that it wonder why op got this ad they have giant billboards such as these all over the us this is not unique to india jesus fucking christ actually this is real popular in china sapios have invented time travels to create sanskari bahu oofyou ve never been to south florida have you what ve never heard

this will really take off in america sometime in the future oh my godr mildlypenis badwomansanatomywomen shouldn be judged if they are virgin does it really matter if the girl is virgin or not think as long as she loves you and you love and understand her these things doesn matter isn it and feminists are only there when not needed well it is rather more establishing in china japan and korea compared to india usually done before marriage to satiate little egos of men who can live with the fact that sex is part of every day life and not sacred what the cinnamon toast fuck is this guys if she a virgin at just know that she been through this process but don understand why does it matter if she is virgin or not joint inbred nri uppercaste hindu family wedding in nutshell excuse me what

dislike how ladies are mistreated in some narrow and backward minded societies in such ways in fact feel that such rules were concocted by some people to legitimise some of their wrongdoings behind closed doors but bad mouth the broader subject sphere of this wouldn it just be easier to do anal paging alabamais this available for men wtfdude wtfwhat the heck is this why would any girl go for this disgusting revirginisation many countries including us and uk have ppl worshipping the myth of virginitytechnically this may be targeted adwhy am not surprised what the fuck is this yuck but its actually amazing that they cant pull that off no one tell i which sane woman would want this oh it won be woman there reallly no need to exclaim only in india would this pretty sure this will be sought after in many other countries as well like in the middle east other south asian countries etc gross the first guy dated and ended up sleeping with accused me of not being virgin because didn bleed when we did it ended up losing my hymen week later called him up and told him don think he believed me almost years later bastard finds me on facebook to tell me was his true love and that he never really loved anyone else like he loved me told him ours was pretty toxic relationship he didn want to hear it ended up blocking him what dirtbag that very shameless of them now how would tell that my wife is really virgin or this kind of virgin holy shit they ve straight up found way to reverse sex and science is i reading dude wtfhymen is mythwhat the absolute fuck jesus indian gynos way of knowing if you re sexually active is by asking if you re married or not m struggling to find good progressive gyno in delhi if anyone here knows any let me know think they meant to say discreet

kiya jaye th may somewhere around pm it drizzling outside my view was somewhat murky but could spot two men making their way to my place the first year old male virgin by the alias master kalluri dark burly balding yet hairy owner to spare watch parts shop in the south of the city he realized quite early on that this wasn going to feed him so for livelihood he fixed mixies heaters electric kettles for wives undergoing mid life crises no one knew what he did at night the second tillu scrawny tall stooped yellow raincoat wearing year old who was half chinese and half indian this happened in the late s when his mother was pick pocketed by xin chong while shopping in china town it was love at first sight except chong didn quite see it coming tillu primary source of income was being kalluri sidekick he was also face painter at children parties and only did really bad imitation of spiderman girl can you paint me pink butterfly with glitter tillu yes ll do you real good pink glitter spiderman he was usually in luck because the kids barely noticed and one can really see their own face this would lead to confusion between the kids and after while some of them would start to cry he was never re invited they made their way through dingy at this point the narrator realizes that none of this setup bull crap really matters and she is lazy piece of shit to actually come up with something interesting to happen between character descriptions and plot she decides to cut the chase and has simply omitted this part started with handjob on kalluri with my clothes on then proceeded

family and we are inculcated into the business very early what my experience has tought me is that we lose out lot in terms of ideas and humanpower because of age old notion that women should take care of the kids and cook etc etc and even if they do it for small roles like taking place jn emergencies etc etc and not full time active management role why can they be part of the business and the business can benefit from their contribution or is them being at home justifiable am now going to get b on subject in which was easily going to get an because was being lazy week ago and submitted an assignment late if today everything were fine couple of friends of mine would have called me this morning to go the local church with them they invite me and my sis for easter and christmas every year at the church small decorative eggs would ve been placed here and there with candles in hand we have praying session after that was the best part snacks freshly prepared samosas kachories and yellow spongy dhoklas along with them tangy tamarind chutney with some crunchy bhujia on top to complement the dhokla samosa combo we had crispy salted potato wafers the chutney glistening on the piping hot samosa because of the ample sunlight made us salivate every time in the form of beverages we used to have fanta pastor favorite and sprite or pepsi for dessert the church used to ask nearby bakery to prepare custom cake the night before each one used to get chunky piece of the cake which was soft succulent and creamy many of the girls who came for the celebrations looked gorgeous and each one of them oozed elegance me and my friends used to be awestruck by their beauty grace and efforts that they had put in to look flawless after everyone had eaten the pastor would call us in the church one more time he thank us all and we disperse after small prayer this is one of the many yearly rituals activities personally try to follow without fail but right now many of those yearly plans are on the verge of being cancelled ending my streak which d been building year after year all of this happened will happen because someone wanted to eat bat has anybody watched real detective on netflix it has

it to me nobody eats parle anyways collected packets of parle and went to our hostel gate and looked around saw an old labourer sitting in shade and called him gave him those packets and he had tears

every night sohni used to cross the chenab river with the help of an inverted baked claypot to cross the river soon rumours spread about sohni mahiwal romantic rendezvous one day sohni sister in law secretly replaced the baked claypot with an unbaked claypot to put an end to that problem that night when sohni tried to cross the chenab river the unbaked claypot inevitably dissolved in the water she started drowning mahiwal who was seeing this from the other side of the river jumped in the river to try and save his sohni both drowned and died only to be united after death here a famous folk

day we almost burned small town this happened after the dholavira incident so we reached small town called lakhpat after having spent few days attending rann utsav in dhordo lakhpat is sparsely

th century stayed over in the town hum dhordo se late chale the pm toh lakhpat pahunchte pahunchte baj gye the plan toh ye tha ki gurudwara mein stay karenge but jab wahan pahunche toh pta chala ki unn ka koi festival chal rha tha aur kafi devotees aaye hue the isliye humne tent lagane ka decide kiya par pehle hamne langar khaya gurudwara mein raat ko bje bhi hume langar serve kiya khushi khushi unhone aur bhagwan kasam usse jyada tasty khana kahin nahi khaya aaj tak kheer toh amrut thi sakhsat toh langar karne ke baad hum tent lagane ke liye jagah dhundne ke liye nikle gurudwara se thoda hat ke lagane chah rhe the tent kyunki main day festival ka kal tha aur koi idea nahj tha kitne devotees aayenge hum pura town ghumte hain ek baar in search of places to pitch our tent par aakhir mein

phir bhi subhe tak cars park hote hote humare spot tak pahunch jati hain humare tents ke dono sides mein buses parked hoti hain aur har koi hume aise dikh rha hota hai ki jaise woh festival ke liye nahi hume dekhne hi wahan aaye the hum tents pitched hi rhne dete hain aur breakfast karte hain pass hi chai ki dukaan pe ab tak mere dost and name more iconic duo challenge you ko joint peene ki

aadhe ek ghante ke baad woh log wapas aate hain hum thodi der fort ki walls pe beththe hain aur aage ka plan banate hain ki tent wagarh pack karke gurudwara mein rakhenge wahan pe nahaenge aur phir lakhpat explore karenge shaam tak dhang se sab decide hone ke baad hum packing karne lag jaate hain main tent ke andhar beth kar sleeping bags fold kar rha hota hun ki tabhi thodi phati si awaaz ke saath bolta hai bahar aa main bahar jaata hun toh dekhta hun ki sabhi log ek hi direction mein dekh rhe hote hain main bhi udhar hi dekhta hun toh hawa mein kala dhuan dikhayi deta hai aag lag rakhi

day we almost burned small town this happened after the dholavira incident so we reached small town called lakhpat after having spent few days attending rann utsav in dhordo lakhpat is sparsely populated town in the kachchh district of gujarat it unique feature is that the entire town is enclosed by km long th century fort walls also there is gurudwara where guru nanak on his way to mecca in th century stayed over in the town hum dhordo se late chale the pm toh lakhpat pahunchte pahunchte baj gye the plan toh ye tha ki gurudwara mein stay karenge but jab wahan pahunche toh pta chala ki unn ka koi festival chal rha tha aur kafi devotees aaye hue the isliye humne tent lagane ka decide kiya par pehle hamne langar khaya gurudwara mein raat ko bje bhi hume langar serve kiya khushi khushi unhone aur bhagwan kasam usse jyada tasty khana kahin nahi khaya aaj tak kheer toh amrut thi sakhsat toh langar karne ke baad hum tent lagane ke liye jagah dhundne ke liye nikle gurudwara se thoda hat ke lagane chah rhe the tent kyunki main day festival ka kal tha aur koi idea nahj tha kitne devotees aayenge hum pura town ghumte hain ek baar in search of places to pitch our tent par aakhir mein decide karte hain town ki main entrance ke pass mein fort wall ke side mein baj chuke hote hain isliye hum jyada bakwas kare bina hi so jate hain humara tent spot metres duur hota hai gurudwara se par phir bhi subhe tak cars park hote hote humare spot tak pahunch jati hain humare tents ke dono sides mein buses parked hoti hain aur har koi hume aise dikh rha hota hai ki jaise woh festival ke liye nahi hume dekhne hi wahan aaye the hum tents pitched hi rhne dete hain aur breakfast karte hain pass hi chai ki dukaan pe ab tak mere dost and name more iconic duo challenge you ko joint peene ki

aadhe ek ghante ke baad woh log wapas aate hain hum thodi der fort ki walls pe beththe hain aur aage ka plan banate hain ki tent wagarh pack karke gurudwara mein rakhenge wahan pe nahaenge aur phir lakhpat explore karenge shaam tak dhang se sab decide hone ke baad hum packing karne lag jaate hain main tent ke andhar beth kar sleeping bags fold kar rha hota hun ki tabhi thodi phati si awaaz ke saath bolta hai bahar aa main bahar jaata hun toh dekhta hun ki sabhi log ek hi direction mein dekh rhe hote hain main bhi udhar hi dekhta hun toh hawa mein kala dhuan dikhayi deta hai aag lag rakhi

its business with the king the english sneered at how rough we are and rude and simple minded and on like that everywhere he went til one day he was invited to the townhouse of great english lord dinner was served beverages imbibed time passed as happens and mr allen found he needed the privy he was grateful to be directed thence relieved you might say mr allen discovered on entering the water closet that the only decoration therein was portrait of george washington ethan allen done what he came to do and returned to the drawing room his host and the others were disappointed when he didn mention washington portrait and finally his lordship couldn resist and asked mr allen had he noticed it the picture of washington he had well what did he think of its placement did it seem appropriately located to mr allen and mr allen said it did the host was astounded mocking british accent appropriate george washington likeness in water closet yes said mr allen where it will do good

free country is the right to voice opinion of criticism and all of us are well within our rights to voice them but when it comes to calling our government the worst in terms of coping with the covid pandemic think we are going bit overboard don get me wrong our government is by no means doing great job but which other country is germany and south korea bet you could come up with not more than handful of countries so are doing great job at containing the virus the s efforts are laughable even though they are picking up the same goes with that of the k spain and italy china initial lackadaisical efforts are the reason why we are where we are at now france are not doing much better either each of these developed countries government frailties have been put under the spotlight due to the pandemic feel india made great decision with such an early lockdown but admittedly the preparations and the implementation were way below par and modi clapping and lighting lamps gimmicks are not helping either the point am trying to make is even though get we should be concerning ourselves with the issues in our country the foremost we should also consider that it is not just our government who has been bad with dealing with the pandemic there are as bad and far worse cases of governance few of them even in developed countries jo bhi main kehna chahoon barbaad karein alfaaz

bhakts always go step further to show their love all arguments are based on the point where modi is to blame and where the blame lies on the stupidity of people the main villain of this whole act is lurking shadows the one that drives modi to do these magnanimous gestures and the bhakts going step further the villain is social media and its cheap immediate validation of people acts modi is wave on the ocean of time the one who is using the potential of this villain to the maximum who can stop the next person to emulate or even elevate modi acts this villain has encroached upon every aspect of human life be it parents filming children in their age of innocence for validation teenagers risking themselves for thumbs up adults taking stands that they might not believe in real life and everytime this villain shows it magic the real issues take background why even this post is form of that villain where validation received by internet strangers will give high of temporary happiness

hi fondly recollecting my prolific run in community theatre as kid in the neighbourhood grew up in glancing through my photo album there me in my various guises dressed as girl peacock stooping spectacled bengali school teacher with cane mason bangle vendor may aged the last time put bangle on girl wrist how do remember all these photos are me performing on rabindranath tagore birth anniversary between ages and the photo with me as the only boy on stage with some girls varying in age between mine and years older seated beside the pretty girl who momentarily got upset after pretended not to recognise her when she added me on fb decade later mean she had boyfriend years older than myself we lived km apart her mom also my dad senior from school saw yo me naked was thinking was it worth speaking to her aita then that other girl hours not years younger than myself who was also in the bangle vendor drama our dads were childhood friends too on all my birthday parties my playmates would eat small portions and leave by pm to attend her party curiously enough was often the only boy on stage and in dances always the only boy on stage this lovely aunt next door neighbour was gifted bharatnatyam tutor she had like pupils all girls who come from up to km away to learn bharatnatyam never took dance classes too lethargic for that she taught me for fortnight prior to rabindra jayanti every year the drama teacher was colleague of my grandpa ok nobody took drama class almost every year there was this one dance with recurring theme me sandwiched between girls including that girl who shares my birthday doing bharatnatyam routine why was the only boy in all such performances dance drama apparently they wanted all kids the same size being the youngest boy in the entire colony was the only one the same height as girls up to years older than me strong memory never forgot dialogues and dance steps was pale ergo less makeup it stung like hell though however little put on the other older boys in the colony could not be taught to dance for dear life or maybe they bothered the girls bit much aunty my dance teacher could trust me to keep quiet was always unathletic ergo never ransacked her house gah been years since last did theatre and dance rabindra jayanti is next month some of those older girls in the photos have kids in high school some of my older childhood playmates are married turns out the other girl in my bharatnatyam routines the one who didn share my birthday who is my mom best friend daughter had been thought of as potential match

left go unchecked reverse racism reverse sexism etc will increase thoughts long back in college my friend and had general disagreement over an average indian intelligence he used to say that majority of indians are stupid through and through and my position was that they are not perhaps not excessively bright but not stupid over time have conceded my position to him as meet more people realise how naive was due to this in general don care about the stupid things we as people do in this country the banging of plates the lighting of diyas it continuation of same retardedness that made people believe in ganesh idols drinking milk beating pulse polio campaign volunteers and more it nothing new and will likely continue for coming centuries what frustrates me though is people are now linking these beliefs with science bringing prestigious institutes into their bullshit explanations and when given proofs against those either ignoring it or taking it as an attack they actually don need it majority of the middle class is already fool enough to trust whatever is told to them they don need to have it explained to them with science to entice them but this linking is killing the rational scientific thought people are getting their information from babas and tricksters instead of specialists and experts to me the future looks bleak as the general populous is now hell bent on brainwashing everyone and destroying anyone who attempts to bring rationality into their minds totally felt like lighting my n mask on fire and throw it at bunch of people dancing on streets seriously

insights ive decided to continue doing so here why this peer pressure was they key contributor to this feeling and of the root of it all just because my friends and people around me were drinking and smoking felt to do the same just inorder to please them and be part of group know this isn how m supposed to make decisions as someone said ll do it only if want to or need to not just to fit in so fuck peer pressure ll do what want to the other issue was feeling of being left out when people drink which was an effect of peer pressure so ive decided to join friend and have fun with them but when they drink ll have some cold drink as used to do and ll be the one recording all the chutiyapa but but dont you think its something you should atleast try maybe once isn it part of human experience yeah definitely but right now my life going pretty good and just don want new sources of distraction maybe ll do it when the time comes or when ll have serious urge but for now and near future that not going to happen just reading about side affects and disease that can be caused due to smoking and drinking are big no no there is like million stories and incidents that ve read heard about people being drunk and fucking up career relationship friendship health and whatnot probability of me being that is very low but don even want to be favourable case for that also don want someone calling be

getting turned on anil moved even closer he was hard already she could feel his hard cock on her hips as he spoke near her ear the warm air on her neck made her go crazy he placed his hand on the dimple just above the hips here yes she said as she tried gasping for air since her wedding night she hasn been so turned on in years he quickly grasped her breasts and she moved her hips closer to his cock he thrusted she yelled yes he kept thrusting she was dripping from the dry humping she felt his cock twitch you wanna cum she said as she also started thrusting her hips towards him make me sarika turned around and started making out as she grabbed his cock anil placed his hand inside her yoga pants and started rubbing her clit ahhh sarika yelled passionately as he started rubbing the

random daily discussion thread april at am www reddit com india comments ful random daily discussion thread april at last time when modi asked to clap for minutes some people exaggerated it by playing music on loud speakers doing rallies etc and that too for more than minutes this time he has asked to light up candle for minutes let hope noone exaggerates this as well we shall come out of this supposed earth hour safe without any fire casualties here my cat vid imgur com jpkelydthe pm lighting modi asked us to do is extremely interesting someone know who studied physical virology with thermodynamics and knows how to corelate with astrology the altar lamp serves to remind us of the highest aspiration to awaken wisdom prajňa this aspiration is embodied in the gayatri mantra which is prayer for the enlightenment the light of diya produces magnetic changes in the atmosphere of the surroundings the electromagnetic force produced henceforth lingers on the skin for alteast three hours and activate blood cells an immunologist anand kumar has said most viruses will not be able to survive in temperatures beyond degrees that we know the mass lighting of diya and candles will create thermodynamic shield which will trap and suffocate the virus in such situation the fire of diya and the chemicals it releases in air will kill the germs someone very knowledgeable is guiding modi abt this hope it works th april is days before poornima the most optically balanced day in month all virus bacteria and evil forces have maximum potential and power on such days the pm lighting of diyas

reason to divide india and spread religious hatred we don want that we want proper workplace protection laws not debates on tv about corona jihad there are muslim doctors too the ones who were attacked in indore were muslims when you make this hindu muslim issue and these people see news blaming all muslims for spreading covid what do you think it does to patient confidence in them criticise the indore accident but don forget that worse happens to doctors everyday across this country people have already forgotten dr kafeel khan the west bengal incident the maharashtra incident where devendra phadnavis and the hc said that if doctors can take the risk then they shouldn be doctors as if the threat of grievous injury is minor risk and know this will be forgotten too once godi

during the lockdown nizamuddin dargah is in delhi if they wanted they could have walked to airport or embassy but they knew if they do so govt will ask about their activities wrote this yesterday before going to bed and its almost say day break now and m lying in my bed in daze starring at deep shadow casted in the room by the nearby dilapidated building so here my tiny little verbal diarrhea in the midst of falling of into slumber so pardon me if it isn cohesive or doesn even make sense at all yesterday got curious reading the comment from blank where he she was referring to netflix documentary named don f with cats what made me drawn into it was he she had written that it wasn meant for faint hearted person these kind of things really piques my interest as it does for so many other wannabe noir fanatics out there so binged the entire thing which was about eps now getting into show here an unknown guy who posts video on the net the video is horrendous and can be watched keeping straight face some of the individuals who watches the few minutes long video were petrified in disbelief and shaken to the core so at start handful number of these people decides to track down the perpetrator of what they believe and rightfully is nefarious act chain of events unfolds after it and kind of turns into wild sheep chase but in real life though not wanting to ruin your potential experience don want to give away anything more looking by what the evidence presented at the end think the convict played everyone involved in it like fiddle when you have the grand scheme in picture nevertheless feel it kinda left behing lacerating effect this was like something that was straight out of the myths and creepy pastas that get bandied around in the internet lot like the real snuff videos and the other obnoxious stuff found on so called dark and deep web my curiousites impulsive outburst got better off me and now m spending the whole night by endlessly skimming through case stories and watching interviews of serial killers for me its quite riveting to dissect twisted brain that these individuals have got up there all can say is that we may not have any clue on what happens on the other side their side maybe they live in an other world which is not really that of ours anymore place where they feed off the pleasure derived from the meticulous torturing that slowly sucks the life force out off their victims all these mind dives have made me wonder if m insane to be fascinated about these things as manson said you know long time ago being crazy meant something nowadays everybody crazy is it true though only if we could ask the other person lying within ourselves just to be awakened hehe उष क ल स अ धक र क और am violating rule of the forum which is to

treated as catalyst for healthier life and habits sure if your jerking off times day and your life is gravely affected by your addiction of course you re gonna feel many benefits from refraining from that activity but gotta admit that there is some dogmatism and over dependence for it and way too much broscience also use it as instrument to better your life mental health and sexuality the main thing to take away is slowly reducing and quitting habits that oversaturate dopamine levels such as porn junk food and excessive social media then your brain can focus on rewarding you with things that actually improve your wellbeing such as training or cleaning your room or meditating thats the basic jist of it and it backed up by science too much broscience and pseudo doctrines about semen retention and such may actually be harmful to people who are depressed because they put all of their mind into nofap thinking it some magic pill that makes your life instantly better the day you hit

me break it down for ya warning long ho skti hai when student enters rd prof in mbbs he has or years for his pre pg prep bahut sufficient subjects revisions minimum easily ho jaae because he also has that internship year to cover up his shortcomings here comes modi govt introduces next now overall idea is good clinically focussed and mirrors mle in pattern problem lies in the starting batch e us admission most indian states have finished their nd prof exams in feb and now their students are already in killer mode for the last months for pre pg we few states p g etc have the exams in march so we are months behind months is achievable but next happens just after final year we don have more year internship wala so now batch has years while batch of mp has just years with the lockdown delay and let me add little more cream its not fixed whether this lockdown will last more they not mp students have had good leave for month even if an average student is considered he has easily done worth months in this month thanks to online pg classes meanwhile we have been just sitting ducks revise the nd year or start rd year weigh it out easy to say that you start your rd year now if you are worried so much could have if the exams were as easy as school exams even the govt recommended syllabus gave us years for studying the clinical subjects for years they are very important considering revision one has to do the same in year along with prepping for his university exams so whoever was asking why was so fucking angry about mbbs basically it was this exams cancel nhi honge mbbs ke agar lockdown extend bhi hua tih because its fucking mbbs delay is just gonna fuck us more thats it thats all can do is rant and shout about it wanted good pg branch and as of now don even see my syllabus

daily wagers came from rajashthan and up and they don have delhi ration card they can get benefit from this and providing rupees to their benefit to jandhan is very trivial case too their accounts in village and for getting benefit they have to move back to village basically this lockdown forcing this disease to spread all across the india via this migration thing it could be stop in just cities by lockdowning those areas and spending most of the resources to these place no need to block down supply chain and blocking place who are out of danger making their life pathetic very bad decision

instead they push that person away solitude only becomes prison when you do not love yourself and even if you do love yourself it still very dangerous thing and the very benefits of it are the stars

being revealed makes me feel exposed it makes me feel vulnerable they bled out from my brain while was dissecting my thoughts the bleeding never stops my self doubt keeps digesting the clots mirror of my mind are the emotions they reflect the image they leave behind it makes me look rather imperfect am reluctant to share something so close to my heart every single word conveys very personal feeling

really early today so will tell you story about how primary healthcare can thwart epidemics during the indo pak war for the liberation of bangladesh an epidemic of cholera broke out in the refugee camps doctors ran out of saline within days and if not controlled cholera could kill millions that when dr rafiqul islam from bangladesh and dr dillip mahalanabis from india decided to administer ors solution to the patients it brought down the mortality rate to from apparently they bought sugar and salt and engaged the healthy people in the camps to prepare drums full of ors solution both healthy and the sick were then given the solution to drink ultimately simple homemade preparation ended up saving the lives of millions who estimates that fistful of sugar and three pinches of salt have saved more than million lives yet these two doctors didn get nobel have not combed my hair in the last days and have not had haircut or shaved for month look like gareebo ka kabir singh nowi gonna brag as

sitting in the middle of road so basically cows always stress people out thats what they do well guess what since the last days of quarantine there are no cows around none no people no cows all of this leads us to the conclusion that cows aren just animals who live their lives no cows live their lives for purpose to harass people so much that they forget about the major issues this is solid evidence that cows are government funded decoys skal se khud cooking karna padega kya aap bhi woh chutiye ho jo crush ko message krta hai fir jab koi reply nhi aata toh to save face kehta hai wanted

shahfor the average indian the best way to tell if you have covid is to cough on the face of politicians and wait for their test resultsso have question about human behavior especially in today world why do we approach every discussion with the intent of winning it somehow why cant we approach it with the intent of learning from it why are we so offended when we are told we are wrong or misinformed mean shouldn you be thankful when you are corrected on something since you are now better informed than you were before we sure were thankful for learning something new back when we were kids so at what point during our life did we close ourselves off so much when did this become about ego mujhe yha bakwas krne me maja aane laga hai aur pure din yhi krta hui maithe new neighbour has the same washing machine model as me or same brand or company they have the same musical tone when washing is done every time hear the tone get up and walk towards it and have to stop midway to think if had put something to wash or was it my neighbour though he stays floor below there isn much difference in the volume level maybe because it both of us have kept it on the balconies the volumes are distinguishable if hear them one after the other could distinguish but without that can either way end up having to stop doing whatever was doing or in many cases walk midway and think if had put something to wash laundry is frustrating process bc is it sin to not be married and have sorted career at ve seen people doing much worse but somehow only m being looked upon ek acha din jaata hain fir bc chaar din kharab aa jaate hain please lockdown my feelings too can believe that people here are comparing tb with covid they are both vastly different diseases tb is bacterial bacterial diseases are easier to control cure than viral disease mortality cases people who die from tb live for as long as decades with the disease bcg vaccine against tb is pretty much the first thing newborn gets in india it doesnot provide immunity tho covid is viral disease trying to control it has already brought better nations than us to their knees mortality cases of the virus die within days if left unchecked it will affect upto of the billion indians with of those affected requiring critical care upto crore deaths could occur in india if the virus is allowed to spread willy nilly lockdown sanitary precautions can bring the projected mortality figure in india to lac although the virus infects indiscriminately experts have already shown that the mortality ratio will definitely be higher in the poor vaccine in the earliest stages conservative estimates put it at year before it can be availed by the common person the icmr will give concrete figures models of the projected effect of the

expire ho gaye few minutes ago altho he passed away due to natural causes and not due to the virus also death is the truth of all in tb the age specific risk is higher in adults in that it similar to covid the cure for tb is free so even if someone contracts it they get dots and rupees monthly for their nutritional needs so social isolation doesn serve purpose considering we have programs running for tb control and case finding in the past tb hospitals called sanatoriums were there to impose form of social isolation it proved ineffective and that path of action was abandoned however of all covid cases will require respiratory support if we let it run free no social isolation no distancing as per the imperial college model without mitigation or suppression tactics almost of the population is affected and in india alone that translates to million critical cases we don have the resources to tackle that kind of emergency and the poor will be the most affected by this here the

farmer decided to cut the tree and burn the grove his family members and rest of the villagers pleaded with him saying that it was the home of devi but he didn listen the next day he went to the grove alone since no one wanted to follow him soon it was evening and the farmer still hadn returned his wife was distraught the villagers assured her that they will go looking for him the next morning in the morning everyone made beeline to the banyan tree the grove was dark and sunlight barely pierced through the foliage the only thing they found was the farmer axe however the wife was not satisfied

resentment towards the handling of this election when martin luther king jr was fighting against white supremacy and racism in the united states he emphasised on the role of the members who were not black for united front was imperative for emancipation of the blacks towards the end even malcolm accepted gandhi and luther king jr views of accepting the help of the whites in uk suffragette movement which won women the right to vote emiline pankhurst who was the main suffragette would not have been able to do what she did had her husband richard pankhurst not been her backbone in society that survived on its patriarchal ways therefore would like to say on the behalf of the members of ibt that we accept easysleezzy as our chairman who will have to select advisories and arrange cabinet

late night random discussion thread www reddit com india comments fmgx late night random discussion thread so when you are above there a family pressure as well as your own thinking that maybe its time to make profile on shaadi com so did and for the next few months only got or rishte and they were not my type then one pleasant day we matched we decided to meet after skype call she looked even more beautiful than in the video call and the pictures and we had an amazing day time really flew by so we decided to keep dating instead of taking it the traditional way months passed and thought she was perfect really needed no one else she was caring loving goofy and we had that same awkward humour asked her where she saw this going whether she wanted to take her time or should we take the next step forward guess she felt overwhelmed she said that she still wanted to keep it at the same level so respected but it was clear that we needed break we weren on the same page so may as well be the worst months of my life when we were separated she moved away to mumbai for another job she met some two or three more guys know that because toota hua aashiq and stalking cringe know finally after those months decided to get her because honestly felt that she was the one months apart amd did try to meet new people but nope gave her call amd just let it all out she said that she realised the same thing and decided to take the plunge moved back here and moved in we got engaged asked both our folks to let us be in live in for some months so that we don rush into something unforeseen and now

fallen to covid rip quora told my friend about vpn and ab uski khushi chehre pe jhalakti haiwith my limited experience on tinder here is my critical analysis on the girls on indian tinder have this theory for girls on indian tinder let suppose there is tall slim sexy girl earning lpa in corporate job she would obviously get so much male attention that she would not even think about downloading dating app the only reason for this girl to be on tinder is getting some extra validation now imagine girl who looks great but she is not at good place she might get attention on tinder from dudes way above her class second scene is girl who doesn look good so she doesn get attention from her peers in this case she will get all the attention she needs from tinder the conclusion is on tinder you will either find instagram thots who are not doing good in their career or girls who don look good mp mei bhi aa he gaya corona badhaiyaansochta hoon ki sochna band kar doon bc reddit naatak kar rha

the last paper one kid spoke ma am he is dead he committed suicide the silence in the classroom was palpable at times don know if that kid was just pranking us by saying that the absentee committed suicide or he was really no more in this world but deep down it still sends shivers down my spine what made him take such an extreme step why were the kids of his school so ignorant that they didn

happy instead it makes me sad knowing that nothing can make me happy even as m writing this know m only doing this to distract myself and keep myself busy till fall asleep and tomorrow m going to wake up and keep repeating the same life everyday some of you might say that it will get better but know it won because this has been going on for years now every night go to sleep hoping that don wake up the next day existence is pain indeed at least for me for those who wonder what life is please stop because once you go down that rabbit hole you will realise its shit hole the easiest way to get depressed is to ask yourself are you happy and don do that don get into this existential shit whatever life is or isn doesn matter take life to be shit pile its on you whether you wanna get through that shit pile by smelling it and asking what that shit is and trying to know what the shit is made of or do you wanna get through the shit hole doing whatever you can do enjoying little moments getting to your goals and targets and forgetting that there a shit pile or not the reason meditate is to not get to know what life is do it to disconnect focus somewhere else is what all can adviseu

be introducing rural medical assistant like govt of chhattisgarh did in three year course for rural health care the year diploma course was justified as an effort to prepare skilled health care providers for the underserved areas locations of the six institutes were selected to be in rural areas unlike for mbbs graduates the one year of internship for these three year students has

documented that the vast majority of mbbs graduates aspire almost singularly on further specialization through post graduate studies although the curriculum for the year course and mbbs are similar it is still the graduates from the year course who are more likely to serve in rural and tribal areas as compared to mbbs graduates this difference in the aspirations of students is attributed mainly to

their was not even one single girl their and idkwhy people fucking stare at you it just makes you feel so uncomfortable was in line and guy in front on me seemed like college student turned around looked at me then turned again and just had giggle with his friend that mocking laugh ignored then after some while he turned around again and said aage jana hai and can see his friends laughing in the background and it made me pissed so much it was not even genuine help you get the vibe when people are trying to mess with you just said no thanks it fine did my work after that was walking to my car in parking lot and some guy started singing while passed him like wtf why just why then was driving back to home then some moron who was ahead of me turned his car suddenly without even turning their blinker on dude log yaha pe aise drive krte hai jaise unke baap ki road hai was sooo near to get hit then upar se wahi drama krte idkwhy some guys just behave soo badly and make girls feel so

class pass hui thi din bhar sirf beauty blogs padhti rehti thi fir ek din saw ki wahan ek join us ka tab tha who knew ki one day this join us thing will shape big part of my personality it was about writing guest blog posts so what you had to do was to send them an email with sample blog post and some pictures say agar tumhari post is product review so usse related images and sample post and certain information about you so sent my first application to my favorite beauty blog of at that time which was also india biggest beauty blog us samay think it still is ek baar bheja phir baar bheja par no reply then maine almost top sare jitne famous blogs ko bhej diye usme se some blogs replied and sabne yahi bola ki posts thik hai but they only accept pictures taken from dslr pr uss time rhealabs kaise lati dslr phir thode time baad had started reading blog of this girl jisko start kiye hue jyada time nahi hua tha and thoda chhota kam famous sa blog tha she didnt used to take pay for guest posts but mai thi desperate toh maine usko bhi email kr diya and fir uska reply aya ki we dont accept guest posts and mere blog ka sara content mai hi likhti solely toh maine reply me dala ki mujhe paise nhi chahiye just wanna write toh usne accept kar liya us time mere paas itne products toh rehte nhi the so mai mostly diy posts hi likhti thi abhi dekh ke lagta hai they were cringey af fir aise time chalte gaya and dhere dhere uska blog also became little famous but usne bhi kabhi mujhe paise liye nahi bola and maine bhi nahi bola qki hmari dosti hogayi thi bohot achhi toh didnt want this thing to come between our friendship and isliye bhi because loved doing it and it became my escape from reality phir mai th class me pohoch gayi and ek din uska call aya we were pretty close so we shared each others contact number ki rhealabs mai apne blog me paid guest posts start krne wali hoon said ki okay toh she was like abhi months lagenge start hone me but teri jo posts hogi abse uske liye mai tujhe pay karungi and teri posts ke niche tera naam likha hoga so what we had agreed initially was mai jo usko posts deti thi she didnt used to mention mera naam in those posts and wo posts bhi uss ke naam se publish hoti and when she said ki meri posts me abse mera naam ayega it was big thing for me mera first ever recognition it was like isi din liye toh mai kaam kar rahi thi isi ke liye toh mai zinda hoon baki blogs toh waise jyada dete the but she used to pay inr per post at that time toh pure month me maine jitne posts likhe uske hisaab se next month ke th tak mujhe wo paise milte the first month me gave total of posts toh mujhe mile the inr this is was my first freaking self earned income jis din mili thi uss din bohot proud hua tha phir roo rahi thi baith ke

sub consciously made our minds be it our commitment issues power issue abandonment issue or what not everyone of it could be tracked to our parents during childhood having knowledge of nothing we try to imitate the people around us consider their reactions toward situation as deafult believe to curb this parents should open dialogue with their children and not scold or supress their every little whim they should talk it out and think we must question our family structures even if causes lot of strain its for the better also think teenage or early s is the best time to talk about this with parents cause we too are fresh with ideas from society wanting to do something different and our parents aren old enough to die of broken heart also think there should psychological study of criminals so we could find out what was that trigger that made them do that heinous crime for g the incident in gargi college wasn due to bad management it was due to bad parenthood where the parents didn taught their children to respect the space of fellow human being blaming the management is like shooting someone in the head and blaming that the police wasnt present to stop us is it ok to loot each

bi weekly books articles thread www reddit com india comments fihk biweekly books articles thread completed godan was blown away by premchand honestly and cursing myself why haven explored hindi literature much literally had tears at one point reading the hardships the farmer hori faces in the book premchand has way with words have started reading on anarchism by chomsky think lot of people just misunderstand anarchism it is what we humans should strive to achieve wish to see an anarchist society but it seems like far away concept if only people everyone thought logically about humans and the world it would be such an awesome place to live not saying it already isn finished reading the stand by stephen king it was long read went well with the corono pandemic being discussed all over the media m thinking of starting world war next since my college has declared holiday for week it will be good time to just get cosy and read at home read first book in broken earth series it quite innovative in its writing style and approach to fantasy read backstage by montek singh ahulwalia which is about his time in government very insightful about how government machinery works throughout the book his admiration for mms is obvious has given some policy suggestions to improve governance as someone who admires mms myself it was good reading it montek goes to length to show how when need be mms can act decisive and bold decisions chapters about bop crisis crisis are eye opening pc gets his fair share of mention as well standout moment for me in the book was when mms returned extra earnings he earned because of the devaluation during bop crisis before he became fm mms had been working abroad during bop crisis rupee was devalued to make exports competitive as result mms stood to gain some amount which he calculated and returned this speaks of man whose integrity can be never questioned almost about to complete india after gandhi and dance with dragons started the journey home autobiography of an american swami any suggestions for india related non fiction books to read after india after gandhi early hasn been good for reading for me had an unwanted break in the books was reading and now m not able to get into groove m working on making it better hopefully ll start again today reading short story novel and swati chaturvedi i am troll also bought the way of kings finally picked up amitav ghosh the hungry tide early this year since then have been fan of him now reading the first book of his ilbis triology sea of poppies also became big fan of murakami novels due to their surreal plots completed kafka kn the shore and wild sheep chase finished reading keepers of the kalachakra by aswin sanghi its all over the place with batshit crazy connections from hindu mythology and practises to modern science there were concepts that impressed me but then he ruins it with ancient aliens bullshit strangely it also comes out as islamophobia at many points will recommend for pulp conspiracy theories not for anything else am looking for to write book titled captain chaddichandan and thieves it will be about top people who stole indian democracy for their selfish interests you need to write about at least person you can either take full credit or write it anonymously reading storm of war an analysis of key military decisions during ww by andrew roberts british military historian although the focus is on military strategies the author includes some tidbits about civilian society in all the countries and some of the incidents found quite disturbing because they aren exactly part of popular narratives about the war examples french society was ideologically extremely divided officials in vichy france volunteered to hunt french jews to send them to german camps the german siege of leningrad went on for nearly years food was in severe shortage all through people ate sawdust their pets even one another yes some of them turned cannibals ussr shifted their entire military production capacity east of the urals in matter of weeks author reckons that only brutal totalitarian regime like stalin could have achieved something like that stalin regime was so hated in the eastern european satellite countries like ukraine that people actually welcomed the nazis and reopened their churches author reckons that had the germans been kind the local population would have supported their regime and probably won hitler the war but hitler unshakeable view that slavs were subhuman and had to be culled for lebensraum got them into the stupidity of being as brutal on the locals as stalin and ultimately lost them all local support ussr military numbers human losses as well as prisoners are astounding not only did the germans massacre them but they were often massacred by stalin own nkvd if they tried to retreat only finished half way so far great read though ve been reading bands of mourning by brandon sanderson mostly because was in the mood for fantasy and personally sanderson does it best it the last book in trilogy which is also vague sequel in the universe regardless fun stuff almost done with flights by olga tokarczuk www goodreads com book show flights it a random collection of loosely connected short stories chapters some parts resonated with me lot loved it overall one of my resolutions this year was to read more books finished giovanni room by james baldwin it was wonderful read although quite heartbreaking but am sucker for that haha unable to get through even page even since corona started spreading has anyone here read the witcher series how is the book compared to the games m about third of the way through the three body problem really enjoying it looking forward to the amazon adaptation as well read the cat cradle by kurt vonnegut good humorous read with some amazing satiredo you guys have kindle if yes what model do you recommend late last year decided to write and talk more about books instead of only reading them the hope was to kindle conversations around books especially from us indian point of view blog posts are too common everywhere so wound up recording audio reviews of my recent reads and putting them up as podcasts my friends are liking them thanks guys finally have the confidence to submit to wider audience they re here bookasur www anchor fm bookasur do let me know what you think finished reading sapiens enjoyed it almost six months since last read book need to kickstart and get in the flow state but netflix pe bahut content hai been on scifi binge read phillip dick so androids dream and let the tears flow both amazing reads halfway through fydor dostoyevsky idiot which is obviously great read dostoyevsky for me is one of the greatest writers ever every book of his is class act finished reading shoe dog which is memoir from the founder of nike it honestly very good read there were times when had to stop myself from reading as had to sleep have started reading sputnik sweetheart recently my friends recommended it completed the graveyard book its my first neil gaiman book listened to the audio version narrated by gaiman himself and liked it would

anyone recommend three things top books fiction world english top books fiction india english top books fiction india hindi am not asking you to list it out for me am asking for good source where can find these tried google but it either clickbait websites or quora you can understand the resthalfway through man in love min kampf series by karl ove knausgaard suffice it to say that it is an emotional rollercoaster being in mid twenties and reading about family life is overwhelming also just started the ethical slut have month subscription for kindle unlimited can someone suggest the best titles to read on it reading atph by cormac mccarthy and death in venice and other stories by thomas mann while mccarthy is amazing am pretty angry with myself for ignoring mann till now just cant stop reading him am putting atph aside for now reading the hot zone by richard preston the book is based on the ebola virus origins and is really thrilling once started cannot put the book down started reading thus spake zarathustra by friederich nietzsche and honestly haven read anything like that in while he ripped apart the ideas of good and evil like pro seriously thought

so in that private tuition there were just boys other than me and girls that kinda sex ratio only existed in my dreams and all of them were cute had crush on every single one of them so one day after the class as was waiting for my driver bhaiyaa to pick me up saw lets call her rishika standing alone had seen her come with her mom on scooty so assumed she was waiting for her now kismat call it my driver bhaiya and her mom were both late please shut off your dirty mind so went to her and asked about who she was waiting for then we got to talking offered her to drop her home to which she refused still we were now friends days went on we got closer she was really cute and to the ground even started dropping and picking her after and before the class driver bhaiya didn tell my parents he was bruh on the last day of the class just before the boards felt that will miss my chance as was choosing commerce was no man for pcm or and she was trying to get science so proposed her before that had no experience with ladies so did it properly with bending my knees and even brought flowers but she didn even flinch rather laughed at me got sad and just left poor young me yet unknown to the world month or two later her other girl friends tell me that she was using for car rides she told them so and also that she thought was just rich snob she liked using me for car rides she could have been

late night random discussion thread www reddit com india comments fefm late night random discussion thread don have much interaction with anyone from lnrdt apart from some comments do every once in while do lurk on this thread regularly and just wanted to tell that it a part of my routine before sleeping read stories from people here and get fascinated by how lives can differ there are both sad stories and happy stories and so there is sense of support between you guys and feel relieved seeing this there is certain sense of belonging without any judgements it like family there is also the shit posting part but that is the essence of lnrdt it is true that kind words from stranger living hundreds of miles away from you can be more affective than the words from someone sitting right next to you lastly there are lot of thoughts but am unable to process them all simultaneously virtual hug to all love you just saw cute married couple being playful they wanted to get off the metro when they came near the door the husband had nothing to hold on to so he held the grip on the door to which the wife playfully says that the doors are not supposed to be touched the husband says will let go once the driver presses the brakes the wife says no take your hands off the door here hold my hand all this while their teenage think daughter is looking at them and smiling at how adorable her parents are man twitter and news in general is giving me actual depression fuck this shit watched kota factory in last days good stuff but nothing groundbreaking just don get it anymore watched some

over biscuit packet of hobnobs left over packets of tic tacs and finally some more lotion its as if they gave all this because they did not want to take it back again it felt as if they were merely fulfilling formality of gifting it felt insulting and told my mom to give it back to them and not accept gifts anymore this happens every year shitty gifts keep coming in on the other hand few cousins came over and they took time to ask months before if we wanted anything and they planned their shopping for us this felt nice and value stuff they bring each time they not only brought whatever we wanted they brought some nice chocolates and perfumes too and it was not duty free stuff but from the regular places they buy from when went to my cousins place in uk this may too had asked my relatives there if they needed anything from here and put some effort to buy stuff they would appreciate tldr indians abroad if you plan to gift people something in india put some effort into it don give leftovers you dont want to pack to people as gifts its downright insulting or better yet don gift if you dont have anything to gift its alright and we dont care we re happy you are here and there

late night random discussion thread www reddit com india comments fawlmu late night random discussion thread so after seeing news of the communal violence remembered story from my coaching class days years ago we had botany teacher who used to make very offensive jokes but they were obviously jokes so we never minded them but what we realized was made more jokes on muslims so we understood his ideology plus the fact that he was bhakt then solidified our suspicion he made fun of muslims and their food one day he didn know there were or muslim girls in the class one got bit angry and asked him if he had ever tasted muslim home food he answered no she said she will bring some just for him we forgot about it because there was already too much to remember indian education system or days later she brought big tiffins capacity for people one of biryani and one of the sweet dish don remember the name and invited all of us after class to eat it the teacher took one bite and his face turned from sarcastic to that of in awe he was so amazed by the taste that he took some home we saw his attitude change in the coming days he didn make any anti muslim joke anymore so by this just wanna tell how love and logic and food can be better alternative than violence to solve the communal issue me to my veggie friend our starters are our starters your starters are also our startersthe freshman girl already has bf laugh at me pleasemai ladki hu par mujhe tabu hot lagti hainever thought would be scared for the safety of my family but here we are good job india much awaited not really or maybe presentation story ahead thought will make and prepare for the presentation at night and basically pull an all nighter but slept around am thinking ll wake up at am but my lazy ass procrastinated and slept till am and completed the incomplete presentation thought will prepare while travelling didn get seat so wasted minutes doing nothing but texting attended class and waited for the proff who was supposed to take our presentation long story short he made us wait for an hour and after calling him about twice or thrice he finally showed up before my turn girls presented their topics and by this time people have already entered in class asking about him proff he got impatient and was literally yawning and checking his phone in between finally it was my turn and as was standing up to present he stopped me and asked if got the approval before presenting that particular topic like what the fucking hell it is my topic and ll chose whatever want to chose anyway he gave it pass and liked my topic warned and directly asked me to present the results this was win win for me was not ready didn know single thing and here he was being all crazy and impatient to get out of the class and asking me to end my fucking presentation asap and this was it xd tl dr gave not so detailed presentation because professor is big ass jerk and yawns all the effing time theory the police

book about the poilu if ww lasted any longer there would have been revolution starting from the trenches but one night when the rain came down in torrents the tide invaded our dugout and cascaded down both sets of steps at the height of the storm some of the men had to devote all their efforts to building dam which the water then broke through at three or four places we spent the rest of the night battling the floodwaters the next day december at many places along the front line the soldiers had to come out of their trenches so as not to drown the germans had to do the same we therefore had the singular spectacle of two enemy armies facing each other without firing shot our common sufferings brought our hearts together melted the hatreds nurtured sympathy between strangers and adversaries those who deny it are ignoring human psychology frenchmen and germans looked at each other and saw that they were all men no different from one another they smiled exchanged comments hands reached out and grasped we shared tobacco canteen of jus coffee or pinard if only we spoke the same language one day huge devil of german stood up on mound and gave speech which only the germans could understand word for word but everyone knew what it meant because he smashed his rifle on tree stump breaking it into two in gesture of anger applause broke out on both sides and the internationale was sung well if only you had been there mad kings bloody generals fanatical ministers jingoistic journalists rear echelon patriots to contemplate this sublime spectacle but it wasn enough that the soldiers refuse to fight one another what was needed was for them to turn back on the monsters who were pushing them one against the other and to cut them down like wild beasts for not having done so how much longer

waha pe jabardasti ghuske konsa afeem uga loge hagna hai toh yahi hagloi off to bed but will leave you with my favorite love story carl sagan worked on the voyager project with cosmologist named annie druyan and together they recorded compressed eeg of her brain and an ekg of her body as she thought really hard about civilization and earth and humans hoping that some alien species could decode all the pops and static millions of years from now but at the end she reserved the last few minutes of the recording to secretly think about carl it turns out that as the two of them combed through all of human history finding the most important pieces to fire into space they had fallen in love annie druyan then did her best to capture the sensation of being in love the only way she could and then shot that feeling into the cosmos as the best representation of humanity even after the earth is dust and whether voyager is found by aliens or not it doesn matter cause golden record on tiny probe tells us that nothing defines humanity more than love soren bowieguys need your help there this girl in my office that like often see her around the cafeteria and on the floor she often comes by my

the company that engineered this auditory hellscape of an advertisement would personally choke every person involved with the creative process if could if were stuck in room with hitler the devil and

weekly mental health support discussion thread www reddit com india comments faxx weekly mental health support discussion thread why do people think that those who take their own life are cowards you don know what they are facing what they are going through when their complete life changes and falls in span of minutes and the constant daily physical pain that they go through along with the deep dark thoughts that take them to the bottom of the pits with no hope for better future do they have any idea how fucking hard it is to beat that survival instinct and yet they do because the thought of dying and finally being in peace is better than cruel wretched life of misery full of pain and isolation they are not cowards they fought and they fought and they fought fought the battles and the demons and the hell that you would never even imagine and then they decided to go because their condition distract improve they are warriors and they should have the right to peace whether in this

with things m going bald and will soon have to shave my head imagine with jake charles in mind and not terry crews instead can anyone don care about gender help me with looks and the related anxieties and provide some honest feedback could go to rateme or similar subs but m afraid they be either polite or unnecessarily harsh am absolutely looking for honest feedback because it is going to provide validation either way either to me or to my anxieties m also looking for internships in software but due to low grades and lack of projects due to mental health issues which ll be over soon look m optimistic already it might be difficult to find although am genuinely interested in learning and having some exposure am reasonably sure can be proficient in data structures and algorithms and problem solving by may which is what usually required for interviews but it an uphill battle to look for internships without catchy resume d appreciate if anyone can help provide inputs that might help me find an internship am also willing to provide more info to anyone who might be in position to help thanks for reading this far if nothing else did my engineering from tier college graduated last year and currently working in it with decent salary life okay guess work in tier city and live with my parents my weekday generally consist of work commute singing some studying gym running food

hai aur idar bhuk lagi hai gar jaao saaloaaj mahino badh ek ladki se small talk kiya kiss rule you should always follow rule for kissing the rule in kissing is that you lean in of the way and pause let her then lean in of the way and initiate the kiss so if your lips are inches apart you move in inches and wait when someone invades your personal space you will either move away or move closer by having them initiate the kiss because the closeness is so uncomfortable that they have to do something they are given possession of the kiss rather than you coming in like hurricane watch the movie

bhosadbagga hai yeh bsdka doctor abhi tak nai aayaaaj subah ki thread pe ham dental dam ke bareme padhenge what is dental dam dental dams are simple and affordable way to make oral sex safe for both partners but do you know how to use one dental dams are very thin sheets usually made of latex or polyurethane most of them are square shaped they come individually packaged just like male condoms dental dams are available in wide array of colors they can also come with or without lubricant and you can even find flavored dental dams how to make dental dam unlike male condoms dental dams can be hard to find in stores if you re ever in pinch and don have commercial dental dam on hand you can make one at home in india you won find it on stores even rarely available on amazon but are costly around for pack of sheets you easily need sheets per session but you can make dental dam at home using male condom first you ll need non lubricated condom if you re going to use lubricated condom try to find one that uses flavored lubricant since the taste of non flavored lubricant can be quite unpleasant unroll the condom and cut off the rim and tip of it using pair of scissors there are videos available on you tube about how to make dental dam from condom buy condom of large size it will be easier once you ve done this cut down the length of the condom this will create thin square of material that practically identical to commercial dental dams dental dams are very thin which means that oral sex with dental dam will be just as pleasurable as it is without one dental dams should be used each time you perform vaginal or anal oral sex if either partner is allergic to latex try using polyurethane dental dam for fellatio try using condom rather than dental dam check your dental dams expiration date and take it out of its package make sure it doesn have any ruptures or defects before placing it over your vaginal or anal opening keep it in place during oral sex without stretching it since this could cause it to tear keep in mind that you should only use dental dam once and you should never turn it over during oral sex once oral sex is over discard the used dental dam if you re going to use lubricant with your dental dam make sure it water or silicone based to avoid damaging the dam just like with condoms oil based products can lead to breakage many sti can be transmitted during oral sex the most common stis that you can get during oral sex include gonorrhea chlamydia hiv syphilis hpv herpes it important to keep in mind that partner with an sti might be asymptomatic and unaware that they are contagious using dental dam them regularly is key to avoiding many infections thal can have harmful complications baki ka gyan raat ke thread pe have you good day everyone

marriage this year yaha parents ek love marriage ke liye nahi manate uske parents do love marriage ke liye man gaye pahla wala alag caste ka tha dusra same caste ka hai but different state dated girl for few months had an amazing chemistry with her thought had found the one talked to her about the future realized she doesn want serious relationship broke things off weeks ago because was seriously catching feelings for her and things would just get messy on my end felt would end up hurt the way it happened the last time feeling lot better now over with all the feelings and feeling lighter now went on dates since but kept comparing them to her loved how dedicated she was to her work hope she gets to where she wants to also hope delhi is lot less harsher to her now but am heartbroken about the fact that she doesn even want to be friends with me sent her few regular texts asking about how she is got no response really wish we have hung out more and did all those things we decided to do even if as friends hope she has found her people here still admire her though for the kind of person she is whenever d see her the song she always woman to me by billy joel played in my head especially the line she suddenly cruel and she suddenly kind she ll ruin your faith with casual smile from my experience of being single af years of my life chasing single girl for years and failing and trying again here are few things have learnt being single is not equal to being sad and looking for relationship something our unkills and untis need to understand valentine is celebration of love not day to be sad for yourself or for being single love isn just something between two people love can be anything self love is therefore the answer the reason for you not getting chicks guys is right in front of you and you know why you can blame it on not being rich but you will see many poor friends having gfs you can blame it on looks but there are always langoors with angoors etc etc you know the reason improve on that keep trying keep failing better the one was after maybe isn worth it tried to not fall for her again lots of times but so what said above also applies to me lets not be sad on this day its just another day day with no significance finding gf difficult it a commitment have to talk to girls commenting want gf easy can do it anytime no interaction neededi was depressed and wanted to die before you came into my life you brought happiness back into my life and showed me that life can be beautiful and it is worth living you showed me that can be loved too and do deserve good things in my life now you want to go away and m scared that ll go back to that deep dark hole of sadness again don worry about me m used to bad things happening in my life so ll add this one in

of them and wanna change the most obvious one is self pity they think they re the victims who go unnoticed by women because of how shallow women are and or how other men may be better pedophilia lot of them seemed to show attraction to teenage girls it clearly power predator thing they tend to base their entire worth on sex relationships that all they talk about insecurity they consistently compare themselves to chad the ideal handsome rich strong guy this isn just self deprecation but also discarding the effort other men may put towards being better than them rating this one was bitch they rate women with ease racism not only do they want women of certain race but they often whine about how they aren getting women because they belong to certain race or country consistently trying to blame external circumstances for their state some of them go as far as to say they re cursed or there a conspiracy against them they refuse to take accountability for how shit their life may be in general thereby refusing to make any changes if you possess or more any of these symptoms you can categorized into incel if you downvote this means that this is getting under your skin हम घ म च क बस त

weekly mental health support thread february www reddit com india comments fxff weekly mental health support thread february it about time for me don see the relevance of trying to go through the drudgery again and again beg for some patience on your part to go through this post at years of age with no set path for career am utterly useless can even provide for myself let alone take care of others am year old so called general category lower class family man haha how pathetic isn it xb was good student till xth and then the slow downhill started in my scores struggling to pass th in state medium with with just pass in mathematics xb then coming from lower class family there were not enough choices for me to go through either medical or engineering prepared for medical taking year gap nothing substantial came out of it in the end had to go to engineering because sadly in our country gap years are strict no no for any of the stakeholders and could not waste more year xb did tech tech in engineering in applied electronics instrumentation from one of the good private colleges in bhubneswar odisha yes here in odisha so you might have guessed my economic conditions passed with average cgpa of xb no jobs came in the engineering field at last was recruited by the service company name starts with and had to go for it this was years back why because there was no alternate way for me am now the sole bread earner of the family my dad has retired from his job trained in mysore was not from programming background found it really hard to go through the training especially the advanced chapters had to take retest for the final exam since failed in the first one in the retest literally had to take the help of some kind souls who took pity on me and shared their answers passed with retest with minimum pass marks got posted to mangalore here literally at the opposite side of india from where cam from felt alone loneliness became my best friend avoided getting into any projects there be it support or development because knew in my heart that could not do it after gap of almost year there was forced by some managers into support project in this team seeing my utterly bad skills they put into st level support person triage one someone who acts as the first point of contact for customers records their issues creates incidents tickets and passes onto other teammates literally this for year then slowly they put me into an application support where sql work along with niche technology called tm being absolutely weak in any other technologies let alone niche technologies could not really improve upon my situation thus they kept me in bare minimum work state in this one too because frankly could not doa anything else remained in this project for years then took transfer to bhubaneswar here avoided again getting into projects for year or more and then was again forcibly put into support project where informatica unix tm cognos is being used am in this one at present here as well seeing my lack of skills was put into bare minimum level my lead has literally scolded me so many times that have become numb below are not excuses or points to validate my inactions they are just plain naked truths now after all this you and hell would have asked myself what am doing about it what am doing to learn new skills what am doing to even get into another job the answer is nothing nothing why because am listless lack the memory right now to retain anything at all keep forgetting common things or points let aline study and become proficient in programming language lack the logical reasoning person has to learn to actually code lack the mathematical skills now would you believe me if told you had scored in my xth computer science exam consisting of oops and blue java but now know what utter waste was that not worth paise in india and in this hyper competitive world xb since these years now have remained severely depressed with ocd patterns coming in as well my memory has faded my enthusiasm is gone for anything nihilism in my mind have tried to come out of it am not saying this lightly have tried to take away my mind on dwelling on these things and escape through any of the multiple options for person to get some enjoyment songs podcasts movies etc but nothing works after doing any of this feel an existential dread as to what have done in my life to deserve this moment of just happiness says while going to movie or hearing to some podcasts guilt tripping at its finest sometimes in the middle of day see something or think of something and break down tears and only tears even on bright day at night tears are my only friend you might think where are my friends or family who can help me the answer is really do not have any such friends whom you can call at am and speak your sorrow and get shoulder to cry on my family well they had high hopes for me my dad and mum had put everything to get me good education and now am in such state they are slowly coming to the conclusion that am an utter failure my lifeline has been shredded by my inactions my lack of skills lack of intent to improve my situation and now too much time has passed and honestly don see any point in it sometimes wish in my loved one mind cease to exist their memory of mine being faded in an instant so that they do not have to go through the pain which they would feel when take away my life what sorry pathetic selfish piece of shit stain am you are thinking this aren you yes am that am all of them and much more but there is literally no way to go on any further for me do not see any career paths for me am not good at anything lack memory lack any interest in any field to be proficient in all doors are shut for me now today while walking down the road suddenly wished what would happen if just walk right into front of any ofo the trucks which are passing by at least people would be spared seeing such an utter wastrel of being which have become to fall down further thus have prepared everything to end it swiftly have put nominations with my mother name on it for the account had have everything which they would need in one email which is just waiting in my drafts to be sent have written my goodbyes to them and prayed to them they please forget they ever had son to erase my memories am written my farewell to my loved ones now thank you dear readers for going through this post you have empathy and pray for it to grow in your heart bye ,Scheduled

coming out of his workplace she waited for the guy to reach the station and bang on the guy was shocked to see her there and went away now the guy texts her stating that he is feeling awkward with whatever she is doing and he don owe his time and schedule to her and needs his own space like wtf dude firstly you are the one at fault who can man up and tell her the truth and secondly how the fuck

which is not reserved for senior citizens to an aged man in bus this one time when was in college was traveling with group of friends from pondicherry to chennai in crowded bus luckily we found seats but the bus was fully packed and lot of people were standing there was white european girl traveling with local friend of hers and both of them did not have seats the girl just sat down on the floor of the bus amidst all that crowd right next to friend of mine who had an aisle seat that woke up the sleeping chivalry in him he offered her his seat and got up she thanked him and took the seat two minutes later she was back at her place on the floor and her friend was on that seat almost third of the bus was laughing at my friend at one point in time he asked us to take turns to stand so he could sit for some time but we refused and kept him standing for an hour before agreeing to take turns guy carted phones around to create traffic jams on google maps www androidauthority com google

bought and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in ankh morpork on foggy night by the feel of the cobbles but the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years man

during thatto be fair you have to have very high iq to understand communism the ideology is extremely subtle and without solid grasp of statistics most of the genius will go over typical capitalists head there also lenin collectivistic outlook which is deftly woven into his characterisation his personal philosophy draws heavily from karl marx literature for instance true communists understand this stuff they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this ideology to realise that its not just regular ideology they say something deep about life as consequence people who dislike communism truly are idiots of course they wouldn appreciate for instance the humour in lenin existential catchphrase seize the means of production which itself is cryptic reference to marx

to people who are demanding the ban on export of medicines from india to other nations have you given any thoughts to what will happen if other nations ban the export of things we need ventilators ppe masks advanced medicines www reddit com india comments fxref to people who are demanding the ban on export of let give them the stuff on humanitarian basis but make it clear that india will not tolerate such rhetoric the call isn to stop exports but to be vocal against such bullying we die removed think one of the reason why people are demanding ban on hcq is the uncertainty towards the availability of hcq for indians at this crucial times ofcourse it stupid to think profit being selfish here but its no brainer to understand the consequences if there a shortage of the drug in the country we never know how this pandemic thingy will end in india as far as ppe and ventilators are concerned some psus have started making it already gwalior drde is manufacturing k masks each week whereas drdo is using an adhesive which is used to build suits for paratrooper to make ppes hazmat suits they are likely to produce around k ppes every week baboon on the other hand gave clear indications of retaliation incase of ban heard india already agreed to export hcq to neighboring countries including us thing is no one is against exports but first we need to think of our people imperialist countries like usa will pressure or force other counties for their interests we don need to bow down to compromise for our people lives no one will give us ventilators or ppe if there is shortage in their countries india should be able to manufacture the majority of the ppe drugs etc that she currently depends on other nations for especially believe this given india large population morarji desai had the right idea about fostering indigenous business in order to ensure self reliance this is not direct response to your post agree actually we should treat others the way we expect to be treated but with our large population supposed rapid rate of development etc we really should be able to make all these things just another reason find much of india progress to be bogus bhakts boycott chinese goods goi we have imported ppes from china as we messed up on getting our ppe requirements in the tender sent out and who rapped us on our knuckles for thatwe should give help on humanitarian basis but are we are we really doing that we only gave hcq only because we were bullied if we wanted to give it on humanitarian basis we wouldn have imposed the ban on the first place we won see ventilators until the first world has enough of them most of people spoke with think india invented those medicines and has absolute control over the intellectual property and production what shitfest india should and have to provide these generics as and when needed part law part business commitmentsam curious many states have china was donated ppe and ventilator from india and other countries italy included but seeing that it charging italy to get back its own donations leave alone fresh ones are going to hard to get and then it the quality control issues with many states netherlands and finland including highlighting issues usa is actively cornering the market on ppe and ventilators hijacking domestic orders and out bidding on international ones so good idea but if this continues the only ppe and ventilators available will be the domestic ones countries are increasingly fighting for drugs and ppe and ventilators so at the very least sending supplies to other countries must be after ensuring domestic supplies or getting proper quid pro quo also this as well www reddit com india comments fxw hydroxychloroquine shortage in india as modi govt utm medium android app utm source sharebullshit their is no argument against ban as donaldfarfrae mentioned the export could be done through special permission on humanitarian basis there is no such thing as equality among countries they don like india and third world countries they will not hesitate to fuck up india for their own gains and by they specially mean nato hcq could come under these special permission but ventilators and masks are not until we have atleast have enough to safeguard our medical premises and front liners specially why do absolutely dislike the idea of export because they fucking don give shit about india throughout the history us have always considered us as threat while india have always been generous our space missions are absolute eyesores for them hypothetically if countries like japan vietnam need it then there is no problem never forget agree but they shouldn have bent over to trump threats which mean absolutely nothing why should we show such incompetent diplomacy any charity we need to see that we have enough for ourselves first then export how can we give out meds if our own will die for lack of the same first of all it about india succumbing to

the most indian wayshe is avoiding real doctors and their questions and complains and gaining public support by talking with ancient indian medicine aka ayurved doctors masterstroke trying to solve actual issues with pseudoscience india superpower we are doomed came here to point out that homeopathy is pseudoscience and waste of time and effort having said that yoga are great exercises to stimulate your organs and could give you mental peace and physical vitality get good teacher or trainer and practice it its dope when was kid think about or years old emptied whole bottle of my grandmother homeopathic pills into my mouth because they tasted good my grandmother panicked and rushed me to the doctor and he just asked her to give me cup of strong coffee nothing bad happened to me of course it was just sugar after all the side effect to that episode was that that was the first time drank coffee developed taste for it and made my mother give me coffee everyday instead of bournvita that was few decades ago though in this day and age wouldn recommend swallowing whole bottle of homeopathic pills am told some homeopathic pharmacies mix their pills with regular painkillers and steroids to make them effective that day isn far when he will say go india drink gau mutra he gonna cure corona with essential oils modi karen confirmed wanakkam patterns how can we expect our society to get better intellectually when this is all that our leader has to offer primeme memesterand also the increasing use of homeopathy in many cases is have seen people take both the modern allopathic medicine and homeopathy together and when the treatment works they easily attribute it to homeopathy facepalm momentthe leader with no leadershipi have no belief in homeopathy but m willing to grant that there are some ayurvedic formulations that are good for wellness and for the immune system in particular it appears that covid patients whose immunity is compromised are the ones most at risk so it behooves all of us to maintain our health that said ayurveda and homeopathy are both able to get away with pseudoscience and tall claims because there are no official checks no randomised trials no threshold of what constitutes cure vs placebo no long term studies of the effects of consuming various bhasmams no record keeping of patients d say put them on an equal footing with allopathy in terms of rigorous acceptance fda like standards and if they survive good for them and us always thought homeopathy originated in india it is weird how india adopted another pseudo science from germany when we already had ayurveda at home we re all gonna die this narcicisstic clown will stop at nothing do you think it was wise of him to waist precious hours in an emergency to talk to ayush practitioners rather than with real doctors you mean waste and not waist m not even suprised our pm would pull such dick move do you think it was wise of him to waist precious hours in an emergency to talk to ayush practitioners rather than with real doctors as it stands india has some lakh allopathic doctors the country medicaldialogues in lakh registered doctors in india maximum in maharashtra health minister this may not be enough to tackle the crisis especially when the medical personnel themselves start falling to the disease but india has an additional lakh doctors in ayush streams even though these doctors don study the whole of modern medical tradition they still know quite great deal about things like anatomy and physiology it be relatively easy for them to understand the scientific aspects of this disease than most of the laypeople like us most of the patients affected by covid don require intensive medical care if the ayush doctors can pitch in with ways to cope with the mild symptoms that constitute majority of the cases it can significantly reduce the load on our medical infrastructure at this critical time whether ayush is effective at all is grander question that we can answer right now perhaps alternative and traditional approaches have genuinely respectable place in our overall repertoire of medical tools but right now we have to deal with this crisis and must not hesitate to throw everything we have at it because unlike those entitled allopathy schmucks who rely on research and clinical trials homoeopathy already has cure for coronavirus we ve had it since the s it arsenicum album i guess ll have to start my comment with m not modi supporter can you please provide the source for this claim because the official statement being reported by the press is somewhat different prime minister narendra modi on saturday suggested that ayush medicine producers could utilise their resources to produce essential items such as sanitisers keeping in mind the high demand for such items following the coronavirus outbreak the prime minister also said there is need to counter unsubstantiated claims that ayush has the cure for the disease read more at

washing their hands off any responsibility this form achieves absolutely nothing oh the whole nation is having crisis and is on the verge of recession here fill this form indian bureaucracy at its finest easiest thing to do is get plans from everyone instead of preparing one plan also what about no corporate class she only looks at corporate that minority in indiaas long as our govt maintains the same stance we re in for ride for recession keep some savings in cash with you until we recover guys otoh giving away care packages in billions dollars or trillions of dollars to fix the economy like us is doing will lead to inflation if this happens or is announced keep savings in gold neither the us nor especially india can afford giving away so much money without printing money when there no income or govt savings we do have huge foreign exchange reserves but it best we leave it for the aftermath of covid the us might be able to get away with giving away care packages since investors started pulling s of billions of dollars from every market and back into us bonds why the dollar strengthened relative to every major currency so yeah if substantial care packages or tax reliefs are announced here for the long run gold investments it is just saying as an sme business owner who literally cannot be prepared for corona because wfh is literally impossible in my nature of business activities this is supposed to be peak season for us because eid is upcoming and there is huge demand in bangladesh and west bengal for what we sell if was selling approx goods worth lakhs per day bb

crisis on top of all this and you sort of get the picture why they re hoping they ll catch lucky break instead of taking decisive steps they certainly won be in position to give breaks or extensions government revenue can take that kind of hit currently the budget was proof of that as for their expertise m sure that the people that actually work behind the scenes and advise these turdbubbles are

there to take all the blame otherwise we would have had trillion economy before s are going to be completely lost decade for india we ll be lucky to get out of lower middle income status the sad thing is the govt will piggyback on the corona virus reason for the next years for all the economic downturn and trust me bhakts will buy it follow indian markets for work and stuff your govt has been giving tax benefits and stuff to the stock markets for some years now at the cost of deficit budget now in the face of pandemic things are go to shit knowing politicos as they are they will probably put up smokescreen and try to distract over some useless stuff the only thing india has going for it roght now economically is that the crude oil has crashed while domestic rates have still been kept up through taxes which should help their budget edit oh yeah and forgot about the gst and demonitizibg debacle that threw cog in your machine tooi believe it a feature not bug desperate insecure people are easier to manipulate and brainwashed towards blaming their misfortunes on whoever govt wants minorities migrants opposition etc clueless and arrogant that the deadly combination out to destroy our economy and our lives there is no d or d chess with this administration headed by modikaka they are incompetent incoherent and incapable bhakts will not change source my bf is bhakt and even after all this he is still supporting bjp am damn sure once this corona gets over they will plan to build some big god figure statue to thank on how it saved us from corona and waste more money

providers are risking their lives to battle this chinese made virus which btw is chinese chaal and you are asking such questions thereby demoralizing the country what you should rather be doing is to clap or bang your thaalis at pm on sunday during janata curfew which in the interest of nation is going to happen after mp floor test as congressi and commies are hand in gloves with these cheeni people and yes the govt is fully prepared to handle such or more emergencies and dare you resist corona cess like kargil cess which will be surreptitiously introduced like excise tax increment on fuel and increase in gst on certain products and folds increase on platform tickets it speaks lot about our economy when india th most popular bank faces problems like this yeah m not expecting any improvement in the economy until even if we have the sense to vote in non bjp govt in it will take them few years to repair the damagewhat recession if one does not accept the existence of problem

what you said just mind well using language like dear sanghi morons only divides us further support no party but from my observation feel everyone around me cheers for political party as if they are football clubs hooligans have very different mentality the more you alienate or single them out the more moronic they ll act problem is we keep party accountable not the position not the entire body we don try to regulate and hold public forums to make sure right steps are being taken since fandom drives votes or hacked evms people who want progress can do shit it hard to fix but unity and making everyone understand the big picture would be your first step not saying moron if you ever managed large number of teams you deal with under performers critics cynics go getters etc driving change in such an environment requires openness collaboration incremental education and then subsequent lifts once those processes are in place you feel that those that aren contributing cynics people that are negative etc realize that their opinion isn right and they shut up automatically think that what our country needs right now you bring those morons in your community ask them to help work with you on

world is not prepared for such an incident personally expected the economic bubble to burst for two years now this time it happened due to pandemic the repercussions will be extreme and as usual the

isn it just fucking great how companies like ola valued at around usd billion desperately needs donations from people like us to pay their drivers wages amounting to cr www reddit com india comments fwl isnt it just fucking great how companies like ola not an expert but valuations and actual cash flow are completely different items ola burns lot of money in customer acquisition and is not profit making entity yet the gesture for driver relief is much appreciated they are not obliged to pay the drivers the drivers earn on commission basis the demand they are already doing the bit they can also saw series of articles on how they are working with the govt for waivers on auto loans for their driver community let not take the pitch fork each time and be grateful atleast will not choose to comment on the salary piece personally think it a good gesture note that his net worth is also including ola shares which are valuable only if the company does well which he is working very hard towards made some punctuation changes this post sounds like you just want to get on the anti capitalism bandwagon and say all this without bias m no fan of ola wouldn take their rides even if they offered me free service ola had lakh drivers as of even if it were to give everyone just rs as one time gesture that crores guess most would agree you need at the very least rs to get thru this period that crores so whether they donate or cr it doesn matter if you were ola management you want to start crowdfunding as soon as possible because you re going to run short d appreciate that sort of foresight to assist drivers instead of bashing such moves don forget that they are ultimately loss making entity losing more than crores every year they re not raising vc money to channel it all to charity and like other comments have mentioned they don even have adequate cash in the first place valuation cash in hand do you want them to fuck over all their corporate employees to pay drivers why ola top management has already taken salary cuts with the ceo letting go of his entire annual salary yeah you could argue it no biggie as he still filthy rich but so what what more do you want them to do and why in the first place so why is this surprising are you new to capitalism also when you earn enough in year to feed small impoverished country wot m chutiye valuation is not cash on hand daily reminder that valuation doesn mean cash in hand and yes ceo should just donate his annual salary because unke paas bohot paise that he didn earn with his skill do you even finance mate anyone who posts stuff like this should be made to take course in basic corporate finance valuations are used to get more funding and then they burn through that only to come up with higher valuation next time for higher funding it a vicious cycle ola and such companies can never be profitable with the same approach they re just going down path of no return and making as much as they can in the process the tenet of business is the same today as it was years ago you go on spending more than you earn the bubble will burst and you re going belly up no exceptions lol this is very whatsapp uncle finance logic op you should learn some basic economicsdai first understand the difference between valuation cashflow revenue and runway then write chutiya posts like these most indian startups are money sucking cesspools they claim to innovate but do not uber and all the sharing economy companies are never going to be profitable see their stock calls and annual reports if you think m lying learn basic economy op they probably aren even making any money or it very razor thin month of lock down and following uncertainty is already huge dent in there revenueola caresola is paying its employees the drivers aren employees they don pay their drivers they give the drivers approx of the ride fare denmark govt has agreed to pay of employees salaries for all companies for next months which basically means people tax are used as wage subsidy this happens because companies don have much liquidity financial institutions don have much liquidity to give loans so the govt acts as lender of last resort its not much different than companies asking for donations from people here this is because crazed mentality of indians running after discounts and offers there is no brand loyalty and crazy competition from outsidethat not how company valuations work the billions in valuation refer to their stock you can pay employees in stock you need liquid money it is fuck em btw you re right about the pr stunt angle it makes the little people who donate feel like they re personally invested in the company we re all in this together one for all all for one and all that good stuff when the millionaire company execs themselves clearly aren also loling at all the people shilling for these ahole corporates in this thread far too many of them did enquire about their model the drivers have to give certain amount of money every month to their handler while they get to keep the surplus if they make any that is sometimes they pay it out of their own pocket it insane and all around the

moving back to india salary breakdown question www reddit com india comments fttfm moving back to india salary breakdown question for house allowance do have to submit the rental agreement to the employer to claim it or do have to submit it to someone else e when filing taxes end of year does it get deposited as part of salary each month or is that directly given to the landlord xb let assume your hra component is lakhs at the start of the financial year whenever you join new company you need to declare what you expect to pay as rent for example you may say your rent is months lakhs the company will pay you the entire hra amount every month lakh months per month but since you declared rent of k only the company will consider only k as tax exempt and the will deduct tax on the remaining k there are some other rules around how much hra is tax exempt google it to know more if you declare that you pay no rent you will get k minus whatever tax slab you fall in if you declare your rent as exactly k you will get the whole amount but near the end of the financial year your company will ask for proof of rent you will need to submit rent receipts signed by your landlord along with his pan number if you do manage submit the receipts then everything is great if you don the company will consider your entire hra component as taxable and deduct tax from that month salary in one go which is why it is better to be as realistic truthful as possible else you might find yourself getting fraction of your salary during the last month of the fy so to answer your question the hra money is paid to you the only thing is how much tax is deducted before it is paid out xb do have to do anything to claim the special allowance or is it automatically deposited into the account along with base salary xb assume that the special allowance you refer to is is the component over and above your basic hra if yes then you don need to do anything to claim it it will be paid to you every month minus tax xb how do claim the vehicle and internet allowance is it similar to housing allowance where it comes in as part of salary or does that go to companies directly xb not sure what you mean by vehicle allowance if by internet allowance you mean the telephone reimbursement then the process is this every month quarter your company will ask you to submit your telephone bills if you do submit the bills you will get the reimbursement along with your salary this is tax exempt till the amount of bills you submit xb if you don submit any bills you will get the amount as lumpsum at the end of the year minus tax this is what ve usually seen imo indian companies break up salaries into different components in order to compute taxes easily and to minimise some costs like pf gratuity etc since georgecostanza has already explained point in detail ll explain the second the indian provident fund pf rules dictate that of your basic pay will be deducted and paid into sort of account maintained by the government this money currently earns an interest of about down from over last year in addition to your the company also is required to contribute an equal equivalent amount which is also deposited with the government as part of your pf this component may be detailed in your salary as employer pf contribution note this so called contribution from your employer will not be paid to you and should therefore not be included in computing the amount you receive at the end of the month now in order to pay smaller employer contribution companies tend to offer smaller salary component called base salary pay if the other allowances were to be included as part of one inclusive salary package both yours and the company pf deduction contribution would higher for simpler calculation if your salary is above l then you get between deducted as tax and other prerequisites so about will come as in hand every month from the tax components you need to put it in various schemes and et all to save on tax so that a hassle dont think new person wants to get into esp since the lakh limit gets very easily exhausted and the hra exempt is on actuals so unless you have home loan on your account you dont have much you can do there on the ish you get in hand will be what you get paid and is post tax so if you are getting paid annually simplest tool is to do as your actual in hand salary on the conservative side let me know if you need any help with the specifics,BusinessFinancePolicy

can have their pci dss compliance revoked if they are compliant yes don share picture of credit card use other form of id where do we even report such things have worked in policy bazaar which is sub branch of paisa bazaar advise you to stay the fuck away from these people seriously the are asking for picture of credit cardotp bhi le le bhai wo bhi puch lo only bending over is left at this pointwhen some legit company ask you to have the credit card shared with them they usually ask you to hide every digit except the last one agent asked me for picture of my credit card while applying for cc from different bank asked to talk to their supervisor and said that that not allowed and asked them to quote any circular or document that made it mandatory for me to submit such proof and if not cancel my application they didn and processed my application without the cc photographs we need media houses to cover this this is super shadythere this cred app which asks for username and password for my amex account was baffled and wrote to them they were very casual about it and basically said hey it optional in case if you want us to send reminders for your amex card listened to the founder in one of the interviews saala aise badi badi baatein karta tha revolutionary types all fluff and marketing report themin linked page for the same two wheeler loan the accepted identity documents list changes imgur com xvlx webpi had to do this once for an airline ticket because it was an emergency bought the ticket and cancelled the cc immediately afterwards extremely never sharei on social media cleanse can someone please post this on facebook and twitter not just shady it is fucking easy to code ocr at home for all the images parse cvv and then try for international transactions if intl transaction is enabled cvv is enough for transactions no otp no securecode nothing judging by the look of the site the company aukaat looks like pissing off employees and employees running away with easily accessible data worked in similar company on different field and such misuse were rampant with userdata doubt this is hanlon razor this is pure scammy design at one point was thinking of getting credit card from hsbc and they had this requirement if you previously held another credit card nope out of the application can you share the website link for the same page m not able to see the requirement of cc photos use other id do not provide credit card details just no don give them reminds me of this youtu be syuybobra wait are paisa bazar and policybazar related should take caution now its removedthis is totally wrongupload the letter which rachel wrote to ross in season pages front back the webpage was last updated st july wowhow can this be misused this is some seriously fucked up shitcan believe this they need the back too oyou can complain to nclt national company law tribunalwhy are they even asking for picture why can we just fill in the details and just run it through hash function this is like saving your password in plain text and not hash he should have also asked in otp whenever requiredif it feels like scam it definitely is it better to be safe than sorry never trust anyone any organization with these details these world is driven by greed and falsehood it illegal someone should file report this is kind of shit scenario that aadhaar was supposed to address you do not need to send fifteen different documents to prove your identity one identity verified by trusted source should be enough instead we have perpetuation of this silliness where each one of these identity proofs can be spoofed hate it when scammers or anyone for that matter don do stuff properly if you are going to do job go all the way no need to do half assed job it is requirement by hdfc bank and clearly mentioned on their website paisabazaar is asking documents as per bank requirements sharing the bank website link here www hdfcbank com personal borrow popular loans two wheeler loan documentation www hdfcbank com personal borrow popular loans two wheeler loan documentation think this is requirement by the bank hdfc in this case that what their website says www hdfcbank com personal borrow popular loans two wheeler loan documentation paisabazaar is just facilitating the information don think they ask for your cc info the bank which is offering you the loan may picture of credit card front and back what about cvv lol front and back and you asking if this is shady personally wouldn take loan but having credit card could be useful in emergencies as far as this process of paisabazaar goes they may be trying to safeguard their own security by having an alternate way of collecting payment through cc for example if you crash your bike and die or it gets stolen or you default on repaying the loan they could recover their funds from your credit card and then you would owe the credit card company instead of the paisabazaar might be wrong but lending companies would not be able to exist without some back up plan to recover their funds you should upload pics of your front and back and see what they respond ,BusinessFinancePolicy

almost half of indian startups don hire women to save on maternity costs roughly of indian women complete higher education and join the workforce but drop out within the decade because of family commitments www reddit com india comments ffxa almost half of indian startups dont hire women to got few issues this article it been proven time and time again that diversity is good for business that sentence contains two links to two different articles which both link to the same bcg study www bcg com en us publications how diverse leadership teams boost innovation aspx so apparently writing new article about an existing study counts as proving that study outcome one more time the number two qualifies for rhetoric such as time and again we can trust bcg known for its integrity and independence in social science research and case studies in general the study itself of course turns out to be correlational study you cannot do much better in the world of business guess can ask vcs to do rcts to test out your personal hypotheses and the numbers might be legit but wonder about hacking anyway the crux of the article argument seems to be this though the law was well intended immediately after it was passed there was dip in women employees in the country total workforce think it a solid piece of data but still not strong enough to assert the conclusion so confidently edit how much did the country total workforce decline by as baseline in case that dip is in absolute numbers of women employed and not women as fraction of the workforce could there have been other macroeconomic changes around the same time that disproportionately impacted industries employing lots of women edit they cite survey by localcircles but the actual data is nowhere to be found the best could get is this article tech economictimes indiatimes com news startups small cos hire fewer women to save maternity costs reporting on the survey which says nearly half of early stage startups and small businesses in survey said they have hired fewer or no women in the last months citing the higher cost of complying with the government six month paid maternity leave policy now that would be pretty definitive however am not confident that the survey was structured so as to allow respondents to cite reason for increased or decreased hiring of women it however showed that about of respondents wanted the current policy to stay anyway the original article seems to be reporting on survey which seems to not be public neither the design nor the raw responses leave alone methodology how were respondents selected how many did not respond etc that why menstrual leave for women would not be helpful it will only increase discrimination and give another excuse for corporations to not take them for jobs add peternity leave and problem solved ah yes but even when we are single employers have questions like you re muslim so why haven your parents gotten you married yet how are they letting you work so who is the ideal woman in the eyes of these companies who is the most employable if you ever worked in startup you know how much is the work pressure usually women hardly prefer to join they join marketing or product management another thing why force cash crunch company to pay for maternity equality doesn work if you shove everything in our throats if the startup succeeds it can create many jobs women leave the workforce because of family commitment they do that in western countries too you just can keep your family happy and have successful professional life it easy to blame the employer and say how sexist they are when it comes to hiring but think about it bootstrapped startup that has hand to mouth existence cannot simply afford paying salaries to its employees when they are not working that too for six months at stretch the government cannot wash its hands off by simply announcing six months maternity for women they should also bear the cost at least partly for the women who do avail the break if you want companies to hire despite potentially losing an employee for an extended period at least provide them with incentives that will soften the blow people in india think having one negligent parent and one attentive parent is good thing for child my mother had to prove to her bosses that she could function with womb my dad didn guess which parent spent more time with me when was growing up and which one was promoted more know this sounds sexist but rarely have enjoyed working with women there just so much drama and stress over petty issues although this is just my experience and it can vary amongst different fields with regards to startups they simply cannot afford paying maternity leave unless the government compensates for it by reducing taxes or something k,BusinessFinancePolicy

theory gujrati food has so many dry snacks because of their long distance travelling since ancient times www reddit com india comments faarr theory gujrati food has so many dry snacks but by that logic shouldn odias also have dry snacks too we were seafaring people too with trade relations in the far east now this is just my theory so take it with pinch of salt it based on my mother and my grandmother account of her childhood basically gujarat is semi arid region and water deficient in most parts pulses generally grow in such areas where irrigation is lacking and rain is scarce back in the days most people consumed what grows in the region groundnut was another crop so you see the diet dominant in these pulses and groundnut oil used is also the same while much of north india used sarson which is non existent in gujarat btw white rice seems recent entrant on the plate earlier it used to be mostly red rice my mom says that they had to queue up with the ration shop when they come to know that white rice has arrived most elders in my family used to eat jowar till s in south gujarat in saurashtra it would be bajra again wheat rotis become popular only recently may be post s my grandmother said that back in the days they would get vegetables only during monsoon and winter for most of the summer they would only eat mangoes which was in abundance in the season sabji was just some pulses cooked into curry like dried chana moong besan etc no green veggies for summer so you see most of the gujju dishes have base of pulses because essentially that what was available actually besan is common ingredient across rajasthan gujarat and maharashtra all historically water deficient states the super fried snacks may be recent addition remember there were only famous shops in my hometown in the s and most of the snack was bought and consumed garama garam after in the morning and in the evening you won get anything it consumption may have increased with it being available in packets everywhere now also they are not limited to gujarat only even south has its variant of murukku the gujarati or rather central indian snacks became more famous recently because of haldiram maybe even the murmura snacks are common in much of india but yes we do like to carry our food along while traveling though that has to do with our save money for meal tendency plus won find vegetarian food problem don think it has much to do with the seafarers they probably had an abundance of macchi from the arabian sea on their way to africa this is the state of affairs the op posted theory based on geopolitics about food and in no way claimed any superiority but barring few all comments are bashing the op or gujaratis about the theory quite plausible it is often the case that even today gujaratis travel with their own food in trains etc this is an indicative of culture which carries food with them and the day snacks such as farsan not just gujarati are quite nutritious and energy rich for journeys but that just my perspective am sure you will find some research about it if interested by far the best travel food have found is hardtack or ship biscuit it lasts years museums have hardtack from the s which is still edible plausible remember hearing something similar on raja rasoi show on netflix don know man there are so many preservatives like salt which would have been abundant in gujarat while it is highly plausible that dry foods would be the norm for sea faring traders we don see the same in the southern foods who traded with sri lanka and indonesia and the eastern coast who traded with the chinese it possible but not conclusive one heard about rajasthan is that their food is spicy because it make people to drink more water than usual given the extreme hot weathergujjus and their besan it the worst thing for nutrition values no wonder the state has highest number of cases of under and malnutrition as compared to india who always worries about that state health and nutrition since decades but why unhealthy snacks do they have sweet snacks because excessive travelling led them to make constant sources of energy man people will boast about breathing air theses days isn this like common knowledge mean was fascinated when first heard it but then ve heard it lotmy theory gujrati in earlier times accidentally dropped besan chick pea flour in hot oil which lead to the invention of of gujrati cuisine sbasically gujju will take natural progression of diet from lifestyle that is shared by many different communities all around the world and then take credit for it as if its unique to them makes sense seeing the general attitude edit downvoting this doesnt make it any less true lol ,Food

doodh nahi deti hai hum usse le lete hai spot on it not like we are an animal or nature loving society otherwise it all caste masquerading as lifestyle choices belong to small backwards village in up where we didn have electricity until few years ago outside our village was basti of the chamars they certainly did not eat lithi chokha unless it was given to them as leftovers all they were entitled to eat was the leftovers of higher castes and they used to take the joothan of both hindus and muslims without discrimination am haunted by moment when was around years old and ran after the ice cream cycle and bought an ice cream and was greedily eating it like pig while boy the same age as me but from the chamar community was staring at the ice cream and at me and still remember the look on his father face his father wanted to buy one for his son as well and went after the ice cream man my mother told me to eat it away from them so that they cannot see and najar nahi lagegi they ate pig and breed them and would sacrifice pig every year to their caste god they also ate the flesh of all dead animals they ate lizards jackals mongoosei don get the cow fascination most cows are domesticated so they grow up for sole purpose of feeding milk to the population so why get offended when people eat it mean the cow served same purpose in both cases to feed people will never get the cow thing it so stupid my great grandfather brahmin moved to west bengal and since then most of our family members are non vegetarians but still beef is very sensitive topic hope someday we can see through this bs it a domesticated animal people stop getting offended am sorry but you are using the words indian and caste very vaguely am an upper caste brahmin from the bengal originally and there is no such restriction for any caste in fact even the pujari eats non veg after doing puja in fact he is fed before everyone else can eat also same is the case in kashmiri shaivism and lot of other tantric sects as well it is only few elitist brahmins mostly vaishnavites who promote such ideas and should be looked down upon because they spoil the name of hinduism we are very vast culture with many schools of thought we can demean hinduism entirely just because part of it is very casteist we need to learn re write and re narrate hinduism to the masses there is lot of hindutva propaganda but let try to see though it and not kill beef eaters or look down upon meat eaters ps did upvote because you started great convo here we need more and more diverse voicesjust like everything else in indiasuch hypocrisy is ripe in india and personally feel there is need for drastic change that would make the society casteless and classless may be m wrong but it time for change in mindset of people of course most people in this country don actually care about animals we all see and ignore the plight of street animals every single day by that argument are jains and bhuddists also forcing vegetarianism or is it only the brahmins who are espousing vegetarianism on everyone kshatriyas were warriors and kings they ate meat so to say vegetarianism has to do lot with casteism is being bit dishonest indian cuisine is one of the few which organically has so much vegetarian food choices instead of just meat substitutes it is sad that even that is used to fuel hatred on this sub hope you find peace op what is this bootleg scroll article this write up is sprinkled with gems like broadly present day vegetarianism in india constitutes form of moral power of minority within hindus with such power being forced on the non vegetarian majority with their consent da fuq another gem the burden of diet purity and vegetarianism is however more on women than men hmm what why is this nonsense just there right in the middle without any preface and conclusion and wonderful theorem proving techniques to prove vegetarianism in india has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals goes on to assume the same thing the morals of indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity proof assume theorem is true theorem is true now done xb there are many things wrong with caste but vegetarianism isn one of them so vegetarianism is bad because of brahmins feel nowadays caste based vegetarianism is like forced practice have friends who belong to the swami caste yet they eat meat and stuff outside in secret and practice vegetarianism at home this is pure bs people are non vegetarian because that comes naturally to them and easily accessible in today world we don even need to rely on meat as we can get majority of required supplements with veg counterparts and remaining can be found in eggs most baniyas vaishyas are vegetarian kshatriyas have high percentage of meat eaters any ism is more about moral superiority than the real thing absolutely we re hypocritical bunch with dung for brains if we had the sense to look beyond brahmin india we see how people thrive with non vegetarian food in their diets it beyond cringe to see our athletes against say australian or new zealand athletes when we moved to the uk initially we had the problem of halal haram coming from muslim family but later we decided to abandon these customs for few reasons in this country you cannot see the animal being slaughtered so you do not really know if it is halal and since most of the animals are stunned beforehand it so not valid thus you cannot be sure of the provenance of meat even if it is from halal animal it is not convenient to be restricted to certain foods we lived in white british area and not some desi ghetto where everything is halal or vegetarian most of the things grew to like actually consumed pork such as sausages pate etc which either my parents knew had pork but did not care or they really didn know islamophobia and also the mentality of most muslims in modern times makes me want to distance myself from them me and my father mother are technically atheist or agnostic so why not eat pork used to try to be vegetarian as far as possible but love meat too much so it didn last longi an avid non vegetarian don crave pork or mutton coz much rather prefer the chicken egg fish combo if you have to bring it up to castes well even among the so called brahmins there are sub casts and happen to belong to top of them and in my entire region across casts and whatever subsections you want to indulge in or care for having the ability to have fish regularly is among the top prosperous blessings our ever so orthodox ancestors can bestow upon us while it easier to chalk it up to caste the choice and stigma of vegetarianism is more about the region and the kind of people who ve rose to power in those regions from ancient times but most of it lies with people who cling to unfounded beliefs in the name of culture and not having the sense or ability to question why things are so ps pretty much any class of people have had access to and have consumed some section of non vegetarian food just go through the manuscripts from the courts of any kings and such you can get your hands on bengali brahmins eats fish it has nothing to do with caste but everything to do with religion naturally some random beliefs might get right definitely nothing to do with compassion for animals either bs as is common knowledge common knowledge is wrong all the time not most of the times all the times the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet wrong again the mostly part is wrong as well as the entire sentence to achieve purity of body and spirit it is necessary to be vegetarian and religious simultaneously who told you is much higher than among those who are not from these communities this proves nothing and helps in no way to make the point you are trying to make the higher the caste the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians this proves nothing and you have no data to proof this and you have not even defined the higher and lower your ranking of higher and lower is based upon an argument you tried to make before which makes your assertion circular ergo no signal but noise burden of diet purity and vegetarianism is however more on women than men who told you it is not burden but choice just because you cannot accept other women choices does not mean your labelling of their choice as burden is correct of moral power of minority within hindus wrong again be if they feel threatened by the introduction circular argument again it their choice and it their right to protest it is their right to protest against the things they do not like just because you do not like their rights and choices does not mean you are correct do not poke your nose into other people choices and rights in this scheme of hierarchy one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung one who eats beef by slaughtering underage calf is not the same as one who eats beef of buffallows the above write up anti semitic and calls for voliance upon bhramins just like the naxzis do and continue to do so the tax paying citizen net ve tax paying no reservation no govt aided college and medicare is an asset not libilaity removed ambedkar also wrote about it in one of his booksto clarify am not against vegetarianism itself it is actually good thing but it is not good to force it upon poor indians who have historically suffered great injustices and many still do if you can afford to chose what you want to eat that great but remember not everyone is able to chose very trueunfortunately in hinduism certain animals are considered more valuable than certain categories of humans gohatya or slaughter of cows is grave sin perhaps only superseded by brahmahatya or killing of brahmins why are you replying to your own post you can edit it they say that non veg makes your mind dull which is complete bs btw to them say einstein and newton weren vegetarians agree with your heading in india vegetarianism is like that but you are going too much extreme on other side and getting preachy let people eat whatever they want this post reminds me of the k advani interview with his wife where she blurted out that his favourite food was chicken hearing this advani was visibly perturbed embarassed and negging her to shut up people who committed big sins in past life have been forbidden to enjoy tasty non veg food in this life use this to shut down any vegetarian who pretends to be morally superior as much on my chicken fish beef pork bang on you forgot the main aspect that connects the caste system and diet untouchability get people getting nauseated due to the smell but there whole different untouchability have witnessed where the vegetarians don want people eating non veg on same table to touch their food or even use same spoons as if some minute particles of non veg are gonna spoil their purity and another mistake we do is restricting this discussion to brahmins the jains are vociferously pungent about non vegetarians most of the shit non vegetarians receive comes from them sometimes wonder how every discussion somehow excludes the nasty practices of that community felt very much in two minds when visited india as vegetarian vegetarian for ethical reasons was of course absolutely delighted to have so many options when it came to food and it never felt like the food had was prepared as an afterthought in western countries you re sometimes lucky if there is one vegetarian option on restaurant menu and that itself will often be please ask your waiter this roughly translate as ask us and we ll go through the back of the fridge and maybe the peels from yesterday fry up what we find throw some soy sauce over it and sell it to you as stir fry for so having so many choices and such delicious options was fantastic experience for me however when chatted with my colleagues while there had more than one of them mention to me how some of their family members would use their vegetarianism almost like weapon one told me that he and his wife were no longer vegetarian and consequently her parents had cut contact for years even after they had re established contact they would not set foot into the non veg couples house for long time they now do come and visit but the couple have to cleanse the house before the parents arrive to make sure that there is no meat in the house at all not even powdered chicken stock and no eggs in the fridge either another told me that an aunt of hers when going out with the rest of the family to eat at restaurant will bring her own food and she only started doing that after not having had meal with her family for years it really made me sad to hear about all this sharing food is such an important aspect of companionship family and culture and to break that so callously and brutally is beyond my comprehension really appreciate this post it actually came up recently in another thread was in like that you wrote this without criticising any one section vegetarianism in india is one of the great plagues forced upon the masses if we could eat beef and pork and other meat then we would never go hungry the chinese eat everything learn from them they have survived some of the worst famines in history yet they are thrivingpeta celebrities and westerners need to stop endorsing vegetarianism and even worse veganism in developing rd world country where most of the people suffer from hunger it makes me sick when westerners praise indians for their non violent vegetarianism sure indians can hurt cows but they have no issue lynching human that supposedly ate onefantastic points put forward vegetarianism is form of elitist thinking and lifestyle and it also repressive live and let live and let people eat what they want ffs ugh and the virtue signaling in social media every single time when there is forest fire this same group couldn stop posting about meat industry contribution to global warming m like yeah the forests stop burning if malnutrition becomes the global standard you don eat meat because of your fucking scriptures you idiot don pretend like you care about the planet the same people do not care about anything else that is happening in india deleted if you replace that vegetarianism with english language in india and non vegetarianism with the desi languages we will reach the same conclusion the thing is poor people always follow the rich people not the other way aroundroot cause is not caste hierarchy root cause is some principle behind caste not wanting to consume meat it a stupid argument comparing caste hierarchy to love for animals you should rather compare the reason why certain castes want to follow vegetarianism wonder when people of kolkata are forced to try jain marwadi veg foodare you against animal agriculture or for it would like to make new post now because at this point there are too many comments to reply individually so apologies for this also thanks for the silver ok so title states that indian vegetarianism has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals that does not mean caste system is the reason for vegetarianism apologise if at any time made it appear that way religion region and availability of ingredients as well as economics are also very important factors also apologise for hurting sentiments of anyone in no way do mock anyone for holding cow sacred but the truth is that cows in india are sadly not thriving most as seen on the road side are actually struggling to survive we can argue that at least they are free unlike other countries where they are kept in poor welfare farms and abused for meat and dairy etc am not against any community or caste am merely against discrimination lot of which is so deeply rooted in our society that we have been blinded to large extent believe people should be able to eat what they want the reason posted parts of this article from is because it is still valid and the whole thing has some unnecessary details otherwise could have just posted link to the original elaborated my own views and opinion in the comments as we can see society is changing and attitudes not always for the better unfortunately being vegetarian is good but eating meat is not bad yes vegetarianism nowadays will benefit the environment but it not be forced on anyone the poorest of the poor should have the right balanced proper diet they have historically eaten meat so it is unfair to take that away from them as well and advocate them to eat plant based substitutes so much has already been taken away from them peace and prosperity bharat mata ki jai can anyone tell why specifically cow was chosen to be revered and not buffalo don think this is sound model considering that the fraction of meat eaters don follow the caste hierarchy mean if caste hierarchy is brahmins kshatriyas vaishyas shudras then going by your explanation the fraction of meat eaters should be in the order of shudras vaishyas kshatriyas brahmins but it more like shudras kshatriyas brahmins vaishyas have seen lower number of baniya caste people who are non vegetarians as compared to brahmins plus eating meat is more like function of how religious someone is if meat eating is forbidden in the version of religion in their region behavioral inertia and economic situation expanding on the last one dalits of my village are pretty well to do mean you wouldn notice when you enter lower caste neighborhood so eating meat for them is not matter of survival and behavioral inertia and religious beliefs take over also don think we should be discussing this because it is implicitly persuading people to eat meat currently nearly all meat is industrially produced which results in great suffering for the animals involved is bad for health and have massive environmental impact beef is worst of all especially the cattle reared solely for slaughter cow needs to be fed tons of food and even greater amount of water before it ready for slaughter in two years in the meantime it has produced s of tons of methane and carbon dioxide then you kill it to obtain few hundred kilograms of meat this is horrible conversion ratio of resources we have raised cattle for generations so take it from me that you need at least half acre land to support one cow now on one hand you ear mark half acre for two years and then you will get say kg of meat or you could grow different crops in the meantime which will give you much greater amount of food products and capture some co in the meantime don see it as such problem in punjab suppose it because caste hierarchy isn as big of an issue as it is in other states it an issue but not as prominent think part part posted as reply to part for tldr scroll to the bottom of the comment part vegetarianism is the natural course any civilization would follow in country with the geographical conditions such as india and vegetarianism as cultural phenomenon religion caste etc is merely consequence let me explain this we have one of the most fertile plains in the world created due to the the extensive river network throughout the subcontinent the most prominent ones being the indus river plains and the ganga river plains million acres en wikipedia org wiki indo gangetic plain en wikipedia org wiki indo gangetic plain for the climate that early indians were exposed to the terrain and the geographical conditions they lived in agriculture was the most optimal means to feed the society as side note agriculture and relative isolation is the main reason for such explosive population the conditions were similar for china too this research paper illustrates the correlation between agriculture and explosive population growth www nature com articles www nature com articles now compare this with china china like india has an extensive river network throughout the early chinese civilization positioned on the east of heihe tengchong line where to this day of the population resides en wikipedia org wiki heihe e tengchong line en wikipedia org wiki heihe e tengchong line china also has two prominent rivers namely yellow river and the yangtze river which led to network of multiple fertile plains the most prominent being northeastern chinese plain this is also where the earliest chinese civilization existed en wikipedia org wiki northeast china plain en wikipedia org wiki northeast china plain en wikipedia org wiki yellow river civilization en wikipedia org wiki yellow river civilization agriculture like in india was naturally adopted in china too given the climatic geographical conditions of the country this again lead to the explosive population growth in china like in india www nature com articles www nature com articles now let analyze the vegetarianism aspect of this situation like india china also had long history of vegetarianism mainly due to the agricultural development the civilization witnessed this later changed people did eat weird hit mongols have significant contribution to meat eating culture in china again due to mongolian geography ivu org history east china html ivu org history east china html huan tsang also notes that indian upper castes were predominantly vegetarian www ibiblio org britishraj jackson chapter html www ibiblio org britishraj jackson chapter html comparing this to non agricultural civilizations more appropriately settlements and nomads found mainly in central western asia europe and mid africa where agriculture was difficult people resorted to meat consumption the first meat production culturing not consumption early homo sapiens ate meat too but they weren civilized yet took place in western asia which then spread to central asia and europe en wikipedia org wiki meat history of meat production en wikipedia org wiki meat history of meat production not only india and china most ancient agricultural civilizations like east china japan south east mediterranean basin adopted vegetarianism en wikipedia org wiki history of vegetarianism ancient en wikipedia org wiki history of vegetarianism ancient end of part read part posted as reply to part what shit ball you are bringing up caste everywherei understand where you are coming from but you ve given such shitty answers to lot of comments makes me wonder if you are just hateful person venting on reddit for ex person asked for stats and you gave an opinion piece and then demanded that the opinion should be taken as facts because it has been said lot of times by lot of people and before you claim that m upper caste hindutva guy and bigot like you ve done in this comment section already m neither of those m not attacking any caste community there is merely an evil mindset that must be changed for the sake of india this evil has been going on for far too long and it will one day encompass all of us if it remains unchecked case in point what is happening to our country todayda fuq why is your post word to word copy of this article scroll in article vegetarianism in india has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals op care to reply if you look at the terminology we use pure veg non veg these are unique to india pure veg apparently does not even include onions and garlic and masoor dal as well as mushrooms and more it is basically the sattvik diet it includes yoghurt milk ghee butter sometimes vegan tourists mistake pure veg for vegan but that is not the case pure veg is for the purest castes non veg is unique to india because vegetarian is not considered the norm in other countries thus the term is not used meat or protein is used insteadeverything have said is true people downvoting my comments on this thread are either bigoted prejudiced or content with ignorance and want to keep the lower castes oppressed removed call this bs come from vegetarian family been one my whole life never witnessed any caste or religion based discrimination india is too big for such broad generalizations can speak for north indians punjabis including delhi are mostly vegetarians and also the most cosmopolitan of hindus and have the least level of discrimination based on caste religion or race have second hand knowledge for rest of india still the love respect and acceptance of animals in india is impressive and admirable whatever the reason may be how hindus arrived to this but vegetarianism is the future and the way to go vegetarianism and respect for all lives is only increasing in the world it is actually one of the most important strategies to manage climate change and its impact know about vegetarians except for the handful religious nutjobs nobody cares about caste or purity most vegetarians do not want meat because of the eek factor the smell or death the whole idea of boiling dead bodies and eating flesh is insane disgusting and most importantly extremely disturbing would you be comfortable if dog meat was introduced in schools ,Food

display for everyone to see came so hard that it shot out of my dick like surface to air missile my thick sticky cum covered my kill la kill shirt the whole class was staring knew they knew but had to clean myself up thought had covered the camera when got up but the whole class saw my semi hard dick in all its four inches of glory the teacher kicked me from the class and pmd me to let me know that
